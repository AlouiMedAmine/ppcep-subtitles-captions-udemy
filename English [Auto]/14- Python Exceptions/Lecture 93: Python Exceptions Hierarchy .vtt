Hi everyone!

00:01.960 --> 00:04.600
Let's discover together Python exceptions.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.400
Hierarchy in Python.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.200
All exceptions are derived from the base exception class.

00:10.640 --> 00:17.400
This means that every exception in Python is an instance of base exception or one of its subclasses.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.480
The base exception class is the top level class in the exception hierarchy.

00:22.960 --> 00:29.400
It provides some common methods that all exceptions can use, such as str and dripper.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.640
However, you should not use base exception directly in your code, as it's too broad and can catch

00:36.640 --> 00:38.040
any type of exception.

00:38.480 --> 00:45.120
Instead, you should use more specific exception classes that are subclasses of base exception like

00:45.120 --> 00:47.240
we see in the last chapters.

00:47.280 --> 00:54.040
Python provides a number of built an exception classes that you can use, and you can also create your

00:54.080 --> 00:56.040
own custom exception classes.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.920
The following diagram shows the hierarchy of building exception classes in Python.

01:02.680 --> 01:14.480
Only the first level we have Bayes exception as a top level class has some subclasses like generator

01:14.520 --> 01:18.880
exit, Keyboardinterrupt, system exit, and exception.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.000
This is the first level of hierarchy.

01:22.960 --> 01:30.920
Exception also has a lot of subclasses like arithmetic error, name error, type error, and also runtime

01:30.920 --> 01:31.280
error.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.680
And this is considered as a second level of hierarchy.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.400
But we can have other levels.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.480
For example, zero division error is a subclass of arithmetic error file not found.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.760
Error is a subclass of OS error.

01:49.840 --> 01:58.080
This means that file not found error is a subclass of OS error, which is a subclass of the exception

01:58.080 --> 02:02.600
class, which itself inherits from the base exception.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.640
Let's do another example.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.450
Floating point error is a is a subclass of arithmetic error.

02:10.490 --> 02:17.570
Arithmetic error is a subclass of exception, and exception is a subclass of base exception.

02:17.970 --> 02:22.010
To remember the description of each exception, just.

02:22.010 --> 02:32.690
We need to go back in the chapter building exceptions and you can get all this exception with her description.

02:33.290 --> 02:34.170
Small recap.

02:34.650 --> 02:38.850
Base exception is the top level class of all exceptions.

02:40.690 --> 02:48.090
Exception is considered as the base of all other exceptions like here in this diagram.

02:49.010 --> 02:55.970
And we have also other exception like generator exit, keyboard interrupt and system exit.

02:57.570 --> 03:05.690
Also when we define the try except block, we need to specify the more specific exception class to know

03:05.690 --> 03:07.810
exactly the origin of error.

03:10.730 --> 03:12.050
That's it for this video.
