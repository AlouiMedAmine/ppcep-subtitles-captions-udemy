Hi everyone!

00:01.560 --> 00:04.800
This is a small demo for Python exceptions hierarchy.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.720
We said that Baz exception is the top level class for all exceptions.

00:09.800 --> 00:17.040
It has a subclasses generator exit Keyboardinterrupt system exit and exception.

00:17.080 --> 00:25.040
Exception also has a lot of subclasses like arithmetic error, name error, type error and runtime error

00:25.040 --> 00:27.360
and other.

00:27.400 --> 00:36.920
Some of these subclasses are also a base class for other subclasses like arithmetic error has subclasses,

00:36.960 --> 00:41.640
zero division error, floating point error, and also overflow error.

00:41.680 --> 00:47.440
If you remember, this is overflow error, a subclass of arithmetic error.

00:47.480 --> 00:56.160
We see that in the last chapter, and OS error also have subclasses like permission error and file not

00:56.160 --> 00:57.200
found error.

00:57.240 --> 00:57.680
Let's go!

00:58.320 --> 01:00.360
More Python exceptions hierarchy.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.400
Here we have a try except block for the exception arithmetic error.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.240
Go to implementation.

01:14.240 --> 01:21.490
Arithmetic error has a subclasses floating point error, overflow error and zero division error.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.850
Implementation.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.490
We have three subclasses.

01:34.530 --> 01:35.730
Super method.

01:38.610 --> 01:39.690
Arithmetic error.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.170
Inherit from exception.

01:41.650 --> 01:42.290
Exception.

01:42.290 --> 01:45.850
Inherit from base exception and base exception.

01:45.850 --> 01:48.090
Inherit from the class object.

01:49.490 --> 01:53.290
Base exception is the top class level for all exception.

01:53.770 --> 01:55.810
Let's go to the second example.

01:57.250 --> 02:06.930
We have a single except statement which contains two exceptions file not found error and permission

02:06.930 --> 02:07.330
error.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.650
Let's go to implementation.

02:13.610 --> 02:14.410
File not found.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.450
Error doesn't have subclasses.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.810
Let's go to the base class.

02:24.130 --> 02:27.050
Super method file not found.

02:27.090 --> 02:27.410
Error.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.410
Inherit from OS error.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.210
OS error.

02:30.210 --> 02:34.510
Inherit from exception and exception inherit from base exception.

02:34.590 --> 02:37.510
Let's go to the second exception.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.510
Permission error.

02:40.150 --> 02:41.590
Go to implementation.

02:42.470 --> 02:47.470
Permission error doesn't have subclasses.

02:47.470 --> 02:48.430
Permission error.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.110
Inherit from OS error.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.430
OS error.

02:57.430 --> 02:59.470
Inherit from exception.

02:59.670 --> 03:00.230
Exception.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.150
Inherit from base exception.

03:08.950 --> 03:16.870
Base exception is the top level class for all exception and exception is the base class for all exception.

03:22.350 --> 03:29.350
Exception is the base class for all exception, which means that any exception inherit from the class

03:29.350 --> 03:30.150
exception.

03:30.590 --> 03:39.830
When we define exception, we set that base class for all exceptions.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.990
That's it for this video.
