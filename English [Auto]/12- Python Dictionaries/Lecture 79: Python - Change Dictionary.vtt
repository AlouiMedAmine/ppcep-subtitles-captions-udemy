Hi everyone!

00:01.340 --> 00:04.880
In this video we will learn how to change dictionary items.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.350
You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its Qname.

00:09.860 --> 00:13.850
In this example we will change the value of the year to 2018.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.280
We will refer to the Qname year.

00:19.310 --> 00:26.150
We can also update a value in the dictionary using the method update.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.140
This method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.

00:33.740 --> 00:38.750
The argument must be a dictionary or an iterable object with a key value pair.

00:40.610 --> 00:48.800
Like in this example, we will update the year we give to the method update as argument a dictionary

00:50.210 --> 00:52.850
or an iterable object with a new value pair.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.580
Let's go to PyCharm and execute these two examples.

01:01.790 --> 01:07.730
The first example we will update the dictionary referring to the Qname.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.830
I execute the code.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.960
Let's print the result.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.840
What will be the new value?

01:20.870 --> 01:23.540
It will be year 2018.

01:25.160 --> 01:28.580
The second method we will use the method update.

01:30.050 --> 01:35.930
Just be sure to add as an argument a dictionary or any table with key value pair.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.030
Let's execute.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.110
This code.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.160
What will be the new result?

01:46.160 --> 01:51.320
It will be year 2020 and that's it for this video.
