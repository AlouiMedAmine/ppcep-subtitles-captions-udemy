Hi everyone!

00:01.220 --> 00:04.490
In this video we will learn how to add dictionary items.

00:04.520 --> 00:12.440
Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index q and assigning a value to it, like here.

00:12.440 --> 00:18.470
In this example, we add a new value to the dictionary with the new q color.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.640
The second method using the method update.

00:23.330 --> 00:27.800
This method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument.

00:27.830 --> 00:31.700
If the item does not exist, the item will be added.

00:32.180 --> 00:36.920
If the item is exist in the dictionary, it will be updated by the new value.

00:38.060 --> 00:43.910
Just be sure that the argument must be a dictionary or an iterable object with the key value pairs.

00:44.630 --> 00:47.390
Let's go to PyCharm and execute some code.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.610
Python dictionary.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.210
Add the first example.

00:56.210 --> 01:04.850
We will add a new queue to the dictionary by assigning a value to it.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.900
The new queue color doesn't exist.

01:08.930 --> 01:12.200
We assign a new value red.

01:14.660 --> 01:18.730
It will be at last of the dictionary.

01:19.390 --> 01:24.310
It takes the index for color red.

01:28.450 --> 01:35.020
I'm working with the version 3.13 and the dictionary are ordered.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.780
Any new items?

01:37.780 --> 01:41.320
It will be at the end of the dictionary.

01:43.150 --> 01:48.640
Let's go to the second example via the method update.

01:49.270 --> 01:52.510
The color doesn't exist in the dictionary.

01:53.230 --> 01:59.590
We will add a new item color equal value red.

02:00.070 --> 02:05.380
If this color exists in the dictionary, we will overwrite by the new value.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.630
Let's execute the code.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.540
We need to print the result.

02:14.620 --> 02:15.280
Print.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.000
And this is the new value at the end of the dictionary.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.950
And that's it for this video.
