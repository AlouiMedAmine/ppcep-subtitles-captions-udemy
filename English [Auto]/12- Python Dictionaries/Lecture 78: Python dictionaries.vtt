00:00.020 --> 00:00.710
Hi everyone!

00:00.740 --> 00:02.630
Today we will start a new section.

00:03.350 --> 00:05.240
Section 12 dictionaries.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.020
Let's learn together more about dictionaries.

00:09.620 --> 00:13.490
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key value pair.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.110
It's a collection which is ordered, tangible and do not allow duplicates.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.990
As of Python version 3.7.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.980
Dictionaries are ordered in Python 3.6 and earlier.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.810
Dictionaries are unordered.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.720
Dictionaries are written with a curly brackets and have key and value pair.

00:34.850 --> 00:42.350
To print a value from the dictionary, it will be referred by using the q name like here in this example.

00:42.380 --> 00:47.060
To print the value first, we will refer to the Q brand.

00:49.970 --> 00:55.610
Like we just said, as of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.

00:55.610 --> 01:01.880
When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order and that order

01:01.880 --> 01:02.990
will not change.

01:03.020 --> 01:10.220
In order, it means that the item do not have a defined order, and you cannot refer to an item by using

01:10.250 --> 01:11.210
an index.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.930
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add, or remove items after the dictionary

01:17.960 --> 01:19.340
has been created.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.860
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same queue like here in this example.

01:25.340 --> 01:33.560
And the second value will override the existing value to determine how many items a dictionary has.

01:33.590 --> 01:38.210
We use the famous function length in this example.

01:38.210 --> 01:38.810
The result.

01:38.810 --> 01:41.570
It will be three because we have three items.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.240
The values in dictionaries items can be of any data type.

01:47.780 --> 01:56.300
It can be string, boolean, integer or also a collection like in this example a list from Python's

01:56.300 --> 01:57.050
perspective.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.040
Dictionaries are defined as objects with data type dict.

02:01.040 --> 02:06.860
When execute the function type to a dictionary, the result it will be class dict.

02:07.710 --> 02:14.580
Also, it's possible to use the dict constructor to make a dictionary like here in this example.

02:14.610 --> 02:17.850
Let's go to PyCharm and do some examples.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.620
Section 12 dictionaries first.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.520
Examples.

02:27.570 --> 02:33.060
Here an example of a dictionary created with a curly brackets and a key value pair.

02:33.510 --> 02:37.020
Let's print and execute this code.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.870
We have our dictionary.

02:43.800 --> 02:52.530
We just said that of a new Python version 3.7 and 3.8 and new old version.

02:53.940 --> 03:02.160
The dictionaries are ordered, but to get the first key value in the dictionary, we cannot use the

03:02.160 --> 03:11.670
find function at this moment to have to use the index, but for example, to print the first element

03:11.700 --> 03:14.910
of the dictionary, first key and also first value.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.590
We can use this method to.

03:20.160 --> 03:30.960
Convert the queue of the dictionary to list and select with the index zero to have the first queue for

03:30.960 --> 03:31.740
the first value.

03:31.770 --> 03:43.590
Also, you update the value of the dictionary to the list and use the index zero to have the first value.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.150
This is the first value for it.

03:51.660 --> 03:56.520
To print a value from the dictionary, it will be referred to to its queue.

04:02.130 --> 04:06.420
To print the value of first, it will be referred to the queue brand.

04:07.530 --> 04:15.490
Duplicates are not allowed and we said that the second value will override overwrite the existing value.

04:21.010 --> 04:24.880
We have the second value here 2020.

04:24.910 --> 04:27.670
It overwrite the first value.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.550
To know the number of items.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.920
We execute the famous function length.

04:33.580 --> 04:38.680
In our case it will be three because we have three item.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.990
Dictionary items.

04:44.020 --> 04:47.470
It can be from any data type.

04:47.470 --> 04:48.430
It can be string.

04:48.430 --> 04:53.050
It can be boolean, integer or also a collection like in this example list.

04:54.130 --> 04:59.410
When execute the type function to the dictionary, the result it will be class dict.

05:01.840 --> 05:08.380
We can also create our dictionary from the constructor dict like here in this example.

05:10.690 --> 05:12.910
And we have a dictionary.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.550
In the upcoming video we will learn more about Python dictionaries.
