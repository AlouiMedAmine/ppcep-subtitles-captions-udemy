Hi everyone!

00:01.130 --> 00:06.290
Today we will start learning a new section Control Flow Conditional Blocks.

00:06.290 --> 00:10.250
We will start by learning the if Elif and else statements.

00:11.180 --> 00:18.890
Python supports the usual logical conditional from mathematics like we see in the previous video Python

00:18.890 --> 00:20.480
comparison operator.

00:23.300 --> 00:29.930
We have equal not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to and less than or equal

00:29.930 --> 00:30.410
to.

00:35.780 --> 00:41.120
This condition can be used in several ways, most commonly in if statements and loops.

00:41.720 --> 00:46.100
If statement in if statement is written by using the if keyword.

00:48.890 --> 00:52.340
The if statement without indentation will raise an error.

00:52.370 --> 00:53.720
Here an example.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.430
If B is greater than a print, B is greater than a.

01:00.410 --> 01:07.240
The Elif statement keyword in Python way of saying if the previous condition were not true.

01:07.270 --> 01:10.480
Then try this condition here, for example.

01:10.510 --> 01:12.790
B is not greater than A.

01:13.690 --> 01:16.780
The first condition is false.

01:16.840 --> 01:21.490
We will pass to the second condition with the Elif statement.

01:23.770 --> 01:29.920
The else keyword catches anything which isn't catched by the preceding condition.

01:29.950 --> 01:36.640
Here the first condition will return false, the second will return false, and in this case we will

01:36.640 --> 01:38.770
execute the else condition.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.720
Let's do some examples.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.340
Section seven.

01:48.430 --> 01:50.380
Conditional and if statement.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.410
Here the first part.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.400
The if statement.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.290
Let's execute this code.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.350
The result B is greater than a.

02:02.350 --> 02:10.360
This expression returns true because b 200 is greater than than a.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.120
Just be sure that in if statement without indentation will raise an error.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.840
We can verify that this is an if statement without indentation.

02:28.410 --> 02:32.760
Here we have indent expected in the line 18.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.170
In if statement without indentation will raise an error.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.330
In the second example, we will see the Elif statement.

02:42.360 --> 02:48.150
If the first expression return false, we will pass to the Elif statement.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.330
Elif statement A and B are equal.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.990
The first statement return false and we will pass to Elif statement.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.630
The else statement.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.910
It will be the last statement.

03:08.940 --> 03:19.480
If the the previous expression return false, we will pass to the else statement, like in this case.

03:27.670 --> 03:36.250
A is greater than B because we have the first expression return false, the second return false, and.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.810
The else statement will be executed.

03:44.590 --> 03:48.040
You can also have an else with that the Elif statement.

03:48.040 --> 03:57.130
Like in this example, if p is greater than a execute print, B is greater than A else print B is not

03:57.130 --> 03:58.030
greater than a.

04:00.310 --> 04:01.630
I execute the code.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.320
The result being is is not greater than a.

04:11.290 --> 04:21.370
We can have only if statement we can have if and Elif statement we can have if Elif and else statement

04:21.370 --> 04:24.640
and also we can have just if and else statement.
