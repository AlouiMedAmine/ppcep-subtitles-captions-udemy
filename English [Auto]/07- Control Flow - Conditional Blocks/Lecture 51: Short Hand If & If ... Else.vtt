00:00.140 --> 00:01.130
Hi everyone.

00:01.130 --> 00:03.380
In this video we will learn the shorthand.

00:03.410 --> 00:03.980
If.

00:04.550 --> 00:12.110
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement like

00:12.110 --> 00:13.130
in this example.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.580
Also, we have a shorthand for if else statement.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.180
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if and one for else, you can put it all on the

00:23.180 --> 00:24.050
same line.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.520
Print A if A is greater than b else, print b.

00:29.300 --> 00:34.160
This technique is known as ternary operators or conditional expression.

00:35.540 --> 00:40.490
You can also have multiple else statements on the same line, like in this example.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.820
Let's execute some code.

00:44.150 --> 00:47.150
The first example is the shorthand of if.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.360
If A is greater than B, print this line.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.820
There is no thing in the console.

01:02.820 --> 01:03.060
Why?

01:03.090 --> 01:06.090
Because A is not greater than B.

01:08.850 --> 01:13.290
In the second example, we have a shorthand for the if else statement.

01:15.210 --> 01:16.710
Let's execute the code.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.280
The result is.

01:20.310 --> 01:25.740
B print a if a is greater than b else print b.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.730
Like we said, this technique is known as ternary operators.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.450
And let's let's execute the last example.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.760
We have three conditions.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.690
The first if A is greater than B will print a.

01:43.260 --> 01:46.590
Else we will print equal.

01:46.590 --> 01:49.290
If a equal b, else we will print b.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.230
Why this is the result.

02:00.060 --> 02:02.890
Let's understand this expression.

02:02.890 --> 02:10.900
If A is greater than B, in this case A is not greater than B, we cannot print A, we will pass to

02:12.490 --> 02:13.720
the second part.

02:15.010 --> 02:20.140
If A is equal to b, we will print equal and this is not the case.

02:21.190 --> 02:22.360
What will be the result?

02:22.360 --> 02:27.370
It will be b and this is the output.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.300
Let's update the code and execute again.

02:31.450 --> 02:33.850
We will make a equal b.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.730
In this case the result it will be equal.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.210
A is not greater than b.

02:47.230 --> 02:50.050
We cannot print a else.

02:50.170 --> 02:58.330
If a equal to b print equal, else we will print b, in this case a equal to b, because a and b have

02:58.330 --> 03:04.450
the same value, and we will print the equal in this case.
