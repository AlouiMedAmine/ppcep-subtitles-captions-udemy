Hi everyone!

00:01.250 --> 00:05.930
In this video we will learn how to combine conditionals in the if statement.

00:06.590 --> 00:12.590
But before that, let's remember together the three operator used to combine conditional.

00:12.980 --> 00:18.980
We just learned that in the section Python logical operators we have and or and not.

00:19.010 --> 00:19.850
Operator.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.880
Let's see that in the if statement here.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.850
In this example, we have.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.580
If A is greater than B and c is greater than a print, both conditional are true.

00:34.610 --> 00:43.310
We combine these two condition and these two expressions with the operator, and we have the or operator.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.250
At least one of the condition is true.

00:46.250 --> 00:53.750
To execute this statement and we have the the Not operator, let's execute some code.

00:56.030 --> 01:02.270
Here in this example, a is greater than B and c is greater than A.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.310
We will print.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.560
Both conditions are true.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.230
Let's execute the code.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.170
And we have.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.940
Both conditions are true.

01:14.450 --> 01:19.790
For the operator or in this example we have a is greater than b.

01:20.960 --> 01:27.560
The first expression will return a true and we will execute this line because we just need at least

01:27.560 --> 01:30.020
one of the condition to be true.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.340
To execute this line.

01:36.140 --> 01:39.320
We will print at least one of the conditions is true.

01:39.320 --> 01:50.240
And for the operator or we have a is not greater than B, it will return false, but with with the operator

01:50.270 --> 01:51.170
not.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.270
It will return a true and we will print a is not greater than B.

02:01.310 --> 02:02.840
And that's it for this video.
