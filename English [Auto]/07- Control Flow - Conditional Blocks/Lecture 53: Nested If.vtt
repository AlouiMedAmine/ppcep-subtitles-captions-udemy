Hi everyone!

00:01.340 --> 00:04.370
In Python we can have functions inside functions.

00:04.370 --> 00:08.360
This is called inner functions or also nested functions.

00:08.360 --> 00:15.410
We can have a for loops inside for loops and this is called nested for loops is the same for the if

00:15.410 --> 00:16.190
statement.

00:16.220 --> 00:22.190
We can have if statements inside if statements and this is called nested if statements.

00:22.190 --> 00:27.740
In this example we have the outer if and the second if is the inner if.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.710
Let's go to PyCharm and execute this example.

00:38.270 --> 00:42.470
The result is above ten and also above 20.

00:43.130 --> 00:43.910
For the outer.

00:43.910 --> 00:49.130
If x is greater than ten, we will print above ten for the inner.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.630
If x is greater than 20, we will print and also above 20.

00:56.210 --> 00:59.270
Just remember in if statement cannot be empty.

00:59.270 --> 01:05.750
But if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid

01:05.750 --> 01:11.510
getting an error, an empty statement will throw an error.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.840
Let's execute this code.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.660
Python will throw indentation error because we have an empty.

01:20.690 --> 01:26.150
If the solution, it will be the pass statement.

01:26.450 --> 01:31.370
To avoid getting error, let's execute the code.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.210
Python will not throw an error.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.340
That's it for this video.
