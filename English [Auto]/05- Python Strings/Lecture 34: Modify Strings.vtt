Hi everyone!

00:01.220 --> 00:04.280
In this video we will learn how to modify strings.

00:04.700 --> 00:08.750
Python has a set of building methods that you can use on strings.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.870
The upper method returns the string in uppercase.

00:11.870 --> 00:15.140
The lower method returns the string in lowercase.

00:15.140 --> 00:19.550
The strip method removes any white space from the beginning or the end.

00:19.580 --> 00:26.000
The weight space is the space at the begin and at the end of any string.

00:26.270 --> 00:31.130
Here in this example, we have a space before and after the string.

00:31.130 --> 00:31.970
Hello world!

00:32.000 --> 00:36.320
After the executing of the method, the result it will be like that.

00:36.350 --> 00:41.570
The space will be removed from the beginning and the end of the string.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.310
The replace method replaces a string with another string.

00:46.310 --> 00:51.470
In this example, we will replace the first letter h by the letter j.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.370
Also, we have the split method.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.820
The split method splits the string into substring.

00:58.850 --> 01:04.740
If it finds an instance of the separator, we split the string by that in the separator?

01:04.740 --> 01:07.380
In this example the separator is the comma.

01:07.410 --> 01:12.960
The result here it will be two substrings hello and world.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.590
Let's go to PyCharm and execute some examples.

01:18.330 --> 01:22.860
The first method upper return string on uppercase.

01:26.190 --> 01:28.260
All the string in uppercase.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.580
The method lower return string on lowercase.

01:34.440 --> 01:41.040
We have also the method remove the weight space any space at the beginning and at the end of the word.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.600
At the end of the string.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.610
Here is a string without a weight space.

01:52.980 --> 01:57.720
We have the method replace also to replace a string by another string.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.620
Here we replace the first letter h by the letter j.

02:04.950 --> 02:12.150
We have the split method Use it to split the string based in a separator.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.510
In this example, the separator is the comma.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.450
The result it will be two substrings.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.540
For example, if we add another separator.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.410
Let's execute the code again.

02:26.580 --> 02:32.700
We have a list from four items for substring based in the separator.

02:34.560 --> 02:42.150
When execute the code in this example without any separator, the result it will be all the string.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.080
Hello world!

02:46.290 --> 02:52.200
We can make another separator like that.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.170
Let's execute the code again.

02:56.430 --> 02:59.250
The result it will be two substrings.

03:00.150 --> 03:04.260
The first hello and the second word.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.370
And that's it for this video.
