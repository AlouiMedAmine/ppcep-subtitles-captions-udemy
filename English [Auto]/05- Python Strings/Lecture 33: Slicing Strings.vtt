Hi everyone!

00:01.160 --> 00:04.190
Today we will learn slicing strings in Python.

00:04.370 --> 00:08.750
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

00:08.750 --> 00:15.590
Specify the start index and the end index separated by a colon to return a part of the string.

00:17.090 --> 00:21.440
Get the character from position two to position five five.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.860
Not included in this example, and remember that the first character has the index zero.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.750
Let's execute this example.

00:31.130 --> 00:38.930
Section five string slicing I execute this two line of code.

00:42.980 --> 00:48.320
Here the first is zero and we will start with the index two.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.400
This is two.

00:52.430 --> 01:00.380
And after that Intel for two, three and four.

01:00.380 --> 01:02.640
And this is the three characters.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.990
For this example we can update.

01:06.990 --> 01:09.120
For example, we can make one.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.550
You will have.

01:17.280 --> 01:28.650
The letter E we can update from zero, for example, and we will start from the first letter.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.300
Hello.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.690
Slice from the start by leaving out the start index.

01:39.690 --> 01:43.650
The range will start at the first character here.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.690
For example, when we start when we leave the first index.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.510
The range will start at the first character.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.030
Let's execute this example.

02:06.540 --> 02:06.870
Here.

02:06.870 --> 02:10.650
In this example, we leave the first index and we start from zero.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.830
It's the same example like to make zero in the first index.

02:19.830 --> 02:22.890
Slice to the end by leaving out the end index.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.780
The range will go to the end.

02:24.810 --> 02:31.890
Here we just make the first index and we leave the end index.

02:31.890 --> 02:38.580
And we will start from the index two until the end of the string.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.350
Let's execute this example.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.830
We start from the index 201 to the first letter L until the end.

03:01.770 --> 03:07.810
Negative indexing using negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string.

03:09.280 --> 03:15.280
When we use the negative index, we will not start from the beginning of the string, but from the end

03:15.280 --> 03:21.310
of the string and always the last position not included.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.050
Let's execute this example.

03:32.050 --> 03:40.630
We start from the negative index minus five until minus three.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.300
Here in this example we start from the.

03:47.020 --> 03:51.580
We have 123, four five from the letter oh.

03:54.970 --> 04:02.650
Oh in the position one -5 or -4 and l minus three.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.430
And d it will be minus two not included.
