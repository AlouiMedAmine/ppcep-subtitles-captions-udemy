Hi everyone!

00:00.950 --> 00:03.620
This is a short video for string concatenation.

00:03.620 --> 00:12.530
To concatenate or combine two strings you can use the plus operator and this is an example a take the

00:12.530 --> 00:14.810
value hello b take the value word.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.900
To concatenate these two strings, we use the plus operator.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.220
Let's see the result.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.390
I concatenate the two strings, but there is no space between.

00:26.780 --> 00:33.770
After concatenation we can add a space to have more clear result.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.120
Hello space world!

00:38.120 --> 00:39.710
And that's it for this video.
