Hi everyone!

00:01.220 --> 00:02.540
Let's learn together.

00:02.540 --> 00:07.730
Python escape characters to insert characters that are illegal in a string.

00:07.730 --> 00:09.440
Use an escape character.

00:09.440 --> 00:14.360
An escape character is a backslash followed by the character you want to insert.

00:14.390 --> 00:20.930
An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.040
Here in this example, we have a string surrounded by double quotes.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.270
When insert inside this string a double quote.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.340
Python will throw a syntax error.

00:31.340 --> 00:35.780
To fix this problem, we use the escape character, a backslash.

00:35.780 --> 00:37.670
Before each double quote.

00:37.670 --> 00:42.530
It will be like that, and Python in this case will accept the syntax.

00:43.490 --> 00:47.180
The second example we add a backslash before a single quote.

00:47.180 --> 00:55.730
When the string is surrounded by single quotes, there are other escape characters, like a backslash,

00:55.730 --> 00:58.940
like a new line, a tab octal value.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.960
Let's go to PyCharm and execute some examples.

01:04.070 --> 01:04.370
here.

01:04.370 --> 01:12.050
In the first example, we said that Python doesn't accept a double quote inside a string surrounded

01:12.050 --> 01:13.190
by double quote.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.450
The solution?

01:14.450 --> 01:18.590
It will be with an escape character, a backslash.

01:18.590 --> 01:22.400
Before each double quote, let's execute the code.

01:25.160 --> 01:29.120
And we have the result a double quote inside the string.

01:29.630 --> 01:36.470
The second example a backslash before a single quote when the string is surrounded by a single quote.

01:37.370 --> 01:41.990
And also this is the output without any problem.

01:42.260 --> 01:47.690
There are other escape characters like her a backslash n for a new line.

01:51.830 --> 01:52.850
For it.

01:58.130 --> 02:03.920
And also there are other escape characters used by Python string.

02:04.430 --> 02:05.990
And that's it for this video.
