Hi everyone, let's learn together!

00:02.570 --> 00:04.220
Python format strings.

00:04.220 --> 00:09.530
As we learned in Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this with the

00:09.530 --> 00:12.650
plus operator because Python will throw an error.

00:12.650 --> 00:18.020
But we can combine strings and number by using f strings or the format method.

00:18.650 --> 00:25.070
F string was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

00:25.190 --> 00:33.770
To specify a string as an f string, simply put an F in front of the string literal and add a curly

00:33.770 --> 00:39.110
brackets as a placeholder for variables and other operations.

00:39.770 --> 00:45.650
A placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.570
Let's start by the first example a placeholder which contains a variable.

00:50.570 --> 00:55.970
We define our variable price and we make the price inside the placeholder.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.790
We can also add a modifier.

00:59.120 --> 01:07.490
We add a colon after the variable, followed by illegal formatting type like point to f, which means

01:07.490 --> 01:09.650
fixed point number with two decimals.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.670
A placeholder can contain Python code like math operations.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.820
Here an addition between two integers A placeholder can contain also a function.

01:19.910 --> 01:25.490
We define our function sum and after that we call the function inside the placeholder.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.400
Let's go to PyCharm and execute some code.

01:29.420 --> 01:35.480
Here in the first example, we just said that we cannot concatenate integer and string with the plus

01:35.480 --> 01:38.690
operator because Python will throw an error.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.600
Let's see the result.

01:43.850 --> 01:47.660
Can only concatenate str to s tier, not int.

01:48.230 --> 01:49.070
The solution.

01:49.070 --> 01:55.250
It will be f strings to concatenate a string with an integer.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.730
We define our f string by.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.400
Put an f in front of the string literal.

02:01.430 --> 02:06.680
After that, we add the placeholder and the placeholder can contain variables.

02:06.680 --> 02:11.120
Can contain modifiers, operations, and functions.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.610
Let's execute this example.

02:18.410 --> 02:19.520
The result.

02:19.520 --> 02:27.620
It's like the first example concatenation between integer and string, but with f string, not with

02:27.620 --> 02:28.880
the plus operator.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.560
Like we said, the placeholder can contain a variable.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.600
Can contain a modifier.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.220
Let's execute the code.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.980
We add our variable after the variable.

02:45.180 --> 02:46.170
Illegal formatting.

02:46.200 --> 02:52.200
Type point to f, which means display only two decimals.

02:53.520 --> 02:58.200
The result is the price is $59.

02:58.230 --> 02:59.820
Only two decimals.

03:02.820 --> 03:07.260
The placeholder can contain a math operation like addition or multiplication.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.090
Let's execute this code.

03:11.130 --> 03:11.850
And the result?

03:11.850 --> 03:13.170
It will be like that.

03:13.650 --> 03:19.140
Here we have the result of multiplication between two and the final example.

03:19.140 --> 03:21.090
It will be a function.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.970
We call the function inside the placeholder.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.980
Let's execute the code.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.240
The f string.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.440
It will be your solution to concatenate string and integer.

03:35.910 --> 03:39.180
Remember to put an f in front of the string literal.

03:39.210 --> 03:47.040
After that, inside a placeholder, we can make a variable, a function, a modifiers, and also a mathematical

03:47.040 --> 03:47.970
operations.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.010
And that's it for this video.
