Hi everyone!

00:01.160 --> 00:07.010
In this video we will learn how to join tuples to join two or more tuples.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.430
You can use the plus operator like.

00:10.430 --> 00:13.400
In this example we have tuple one and two plus two.

00:13.430 --> 00:18.080
We use the plus operator to join the two tuples.

00:18.770 --> 00:25.820
If you want to multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times, you can use the asterisk operator

00:25.820 --> 00:27.620
like in this example.

00:28.010 --> 00:31.040
Let's execute this two example in PyCharm.

00:33.620 --> 00:39.260
The first example used to join two tuples, we use the plus operator.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.060
Let's see the result.

00:46.760 --> 00:51.710
We have the first tuple and after that the second tuple.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.710
The second example used to multiply a tuple.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.520
It's like to join two two plus with the same items.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.990
My two plus equal.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.260
In case of three.

01:32.930 --> 01:41.690
It will be join another tuple with the same type with the same items.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.380
Let's execute this example.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.580
We have this tuple.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.170
It's like multiply by three.
