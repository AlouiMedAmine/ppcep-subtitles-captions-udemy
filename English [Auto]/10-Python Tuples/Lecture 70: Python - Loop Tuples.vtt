Hi everyone!

00:01.310 --> 00:04.820
In this video we will learn how to loop through a tuple.

00:05.420 --> 00:09.080
You can loop through the tuple item by using a for loop.

00:10.910 --> 00:14.750
Iterate through the items and print the value like here.

00:14.750 --> 00:22.490
In this example for x in this tuple print x, you can also loop through the tuple item by referring

00:22.520 --> 00:24.050
to their index number.

00:24.080 --> 00:31.640
Use the range and length functions to create a suitable iterable for I in range length.

00:32.030 --> 00:38.630
This tuple print each element referring to their index number.

00:40.310 --> 00:47.570
The third method, using a while loop, use the length function to determine the length of the tuple.

00:47.570 --> 00:53.960
Then start at zero and loop your way through the tuple item by referring to their indexes.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.330
Start at zero.

01:00.710 --> 01:10.430
Loop through each item referring to their index, and remember to increase the index by one after each

01:10.470 --> 01:11.220
iteration.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.020
Increase the index.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.300
Let's execute some examples.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.840
In the first example, we loop through a tuple and we print each element.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.090
This is the result.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.120
The second example.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.540
Loop through the index number.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.850
We use the function range and the function length.

01:47.010 --> 01:53.730
To create a suitable iterable and print each element referring to their index.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.680
In the third example, we use a while loop.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.020
Start from zero.

02:02.040 --> 02:12.720
Make the condition I less than the length of the tuple, and remember to increase the index on each

02:13.260 --> 02:14.130
iteration.

02:14.370 --> 02:16.140
Let's execute this example.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.120
We have the same result.
