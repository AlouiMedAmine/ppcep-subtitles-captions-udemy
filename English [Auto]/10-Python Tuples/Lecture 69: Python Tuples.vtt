00:00.140 --> 00:01.220
Hi everyone!

00:01.220 --> 00:03.380
Today we will start a new section.

00:03.740 --> 00:05.510
Section ten two plus.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.130
Let's learn together more.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.500
About two plus two plus are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.100
It's a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.900
Two plus are written with round brackets like here.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.560
In this example, two plus items are indexed.

00:24.560 --> 00:32.540
The first item has index zero, the second item has index one, etc. tuple items are ordered and changeable

00:32.540 --> 00:34.400
and allow duplicate value.

00:34.430 --> 00:38.270
Let's understand more about each word from this sentence.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.930
What is mean ordered?

00:41.960 --> 00:48.470
When we say that two plus are ordered, it means that the item have a defined order and that order will

00:48.470 --> 00:49.400
not change.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.500
Unchangeable.

00:51.530 --> 00:57.350
T plus are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add, or remove items after the tuple has

00:57.350 --> 00:58.310
been created.

00:58.610 --> 00:59.750
It's not like that.

00:59.750 --> 01:00.590
The list.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.070
Since two plus are indexed, they can have items with the same value.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.930
Here we have an example.

01:07.990 --> 01:10.210
We have duplicate value.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.400
Apple and cherry.

01:13.480 --> 01:21.640
To determine how many items a tuple has, we use the function length to create a tuple with one item.

01:21.910 --> 01:24.520
You have to add a comma after the item.

01:24.550 --> 01:30.250
Here is an example to create a tuple with one item.

01:31.570 --> 01:34.900
We need to add a comma after the first item.

01:36.490 --> 01:39.100
Tuple items can be of any data type.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.510
It can be of string, integer, or boolean.

01:43.810 --> 01:47.830
A tuple can contain different data types at the same time, like here.

01:47.830 --> 01:53.320
In this example, this tuple contain string, integer, and boolean.

01:54.430 --> 02:00.160
From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type tuple.

02:00.970 --> 02:07.990
When execute the function type in a tuple, the result it will be class tuple.

02:10.330 --> 02:14.560
It's also possible to use the tuple constructor to make a tuple.

02:15.370 --> 02:17.260
Let's run some examples.

02:19.810 --> 02:20.650
In PyCharm.

02:20.650 --> 02:21.160
Python.

02:21.190 --> 02:21.910
Tuples.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.860
This is an example of a tuple.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.970
Contain three element.

02:38.290 --> 02:41.050
We said that two plus a low duplicate.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.460
Because two plus r and exit.

02:51.490 --> 02:58.390
We have two value for duplicate value for Apple and also duplicate value for cherry.

03:01.170 --> 03:04.470
Do you know the number of items for a tuple?

03:04.470 --> 03:06.150
We use the function length.

03:07.110 --> 03:11.760
The result in this example it will be three because we have three items.

03:15.120 --> 03:22.560
When execute the function type to a tuple, the result it will be class.

03:25.620 --> 03:26.220
Tuple.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.020
It will be class tuple.

03:31.470 --> 03:35.100
Here this is a tuple from one item.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.600
We need to add a comma.

03:36.810 --> 03:44.910
In the second example, there is no comma after the first element and this element is not a tuple.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.920
Let's execute this code.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.150
It's in str.

03:51.810 --> 03:56.040
Python will consider it this variable as str.

03:56.580 --> 04:03.210
Like here in the execution of the code to be a tuple, we need to add a comma.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.260
After the first element.

04:09.630 --> 04:10.830
Tuple items.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.660
It can be a string.

04:13.260 --> 04:16.230
It can be an integer, or it can be boolean.

04:16.770 --> 04:20.430
A tuple can contain different data types at the same time, like here.

04:20.430 --> 04:30.630
In this example, we use the type function to know the type of tuple, and we just execute this function

04:30.630 --> 04:33.090
and the result it will be class tuple.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.160
Class tuple.

04:38.190 --> 04:43.350
We can create a tuple from the constructor tuple.

04:44.130 --> 04:54.840
We add the items to the constructor and we can create a tuple from the constructor.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.460
Let's execute that.

04:58.620 --> 04:59.220
The result?

04:59.220 --> 05:00.600
It will be a tuple.
