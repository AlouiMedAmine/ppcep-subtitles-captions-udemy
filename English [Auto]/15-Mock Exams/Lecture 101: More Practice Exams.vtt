The second section explanation we explain why we choose the correct answer.

01:17.140 --> 01:26.540
The third section note which we learn more about some Python tricks and best practices.

01:26.980 --> 01:33.660
And finally, a question, a reference to ask me for more details if it's not clear.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.100
