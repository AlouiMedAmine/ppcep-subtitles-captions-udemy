Hi everyone!

00:01.100 --> 00:04.430
In this video we will learn how to loop through a set.

00:04.460 --> 00:09.890
You can loop through the set item by using a for loop and this is an example.

00:09.890 --> 00:18.350
We have our set for x in the set for x in each item print x y.

00:18.350 --> 00:21.530
We have only one method to loop through the set y.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.540
We don't have the same method.

00:23.720 --> 00:32.960
For example, like the tuple we see in the tuple, we can use the index number and also we can use the

00:32.960 --> 00:33.890
while loop.

00:37.940 --> 00:46.280
The problem here is that when we learn the definition of set, we just learn that set is unordered,

00:46.400 --> 00:53.060
which means items can appear in a different order every time you can use them, and cannot be referred

00:53.060 --> 01:04.250
to by index or q, and in this case, the only method to loop through the set is just use the for loop

01:04.250 --> 01:06.500
without using the index.

01:06.830 --> 01:10.430
Let's go to PyCharm and execute this example.

01:13.790 --> 01:21.350
This is our set and we can loop through the set via the for loop.

01:23.150 --> 01:29.930
And we have this output apple banana and cherry.
