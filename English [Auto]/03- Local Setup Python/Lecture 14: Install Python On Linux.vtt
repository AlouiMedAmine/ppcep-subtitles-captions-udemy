00:00.140 --> 00:02.480
How to install Python three on ubuntu.

00:02.510 --> 00:03.740
There are three methods.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.270
First method via apt.

00:05.570 --> 00:12.140
The second method via personal package, and the third method via source code will use the first method.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.770
First step will update the package repository.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.350
After that we will install Python three and in the third step we will verify the installation.

00:21.500 --> 00:27.380
For me, I just run the first two command and we will verify together if Python three was successfully

00:27.380 --> 00:28.250
installed.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.520
Okay I have the latest version of Python three.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.830
After that we will install pip.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.340
Pip is used to manage software package for Python.

00:39.710 --> 00:45.440
I will execute again this command to install pip three.

00:46.730 --> 00:50.930
And let's do an example to understand how to work with pip three.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.640
To install a new package we run pip three install package name.

00:55.670 --> 01:02.720
To uninstall a package, we run pip three, install package name and to verify if this package was installed

01:02.720 --> 01:03.200
or not.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.690
We run pip three show package name.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.820
Let's do an example with Django before we will verify if Django was installed or no.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.380
Pip three show Django.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.370
There is no package with this name.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.190
We will install Django.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.330
Pip three.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.530
Install.

01:32.590 --> 01:33.070
Django.

01:35.890 --> 01:39.070
Okay, Django was successfully installed.

01:39.970 --> 01:41.380
Let's verify again.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.270
Pip3 show.

01:43.300 --> 01:43.960
Django.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.930
And this designation show that Django was installed.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.490
And the version of Django.

01:51.490 --> 01:55.210
And if we like to install Django for example.

01:57.490 --> 02:00.910
We will execute the command.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.000
And install.

02:06.820 --> 02:07.510
Yes.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.070
Django was successfully installed.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.420
Let's verify again.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.070
There is no package with the name Django.
