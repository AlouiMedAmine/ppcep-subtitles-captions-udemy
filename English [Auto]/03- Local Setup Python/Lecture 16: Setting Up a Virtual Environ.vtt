00:00.410 --> 00:03.200
Setting up a virtual environment on ubuntu.

00:03.590 --> 00:08.960
Virtual environment is a tool that allows users to create isolated Python environments.

00:08.960 --> 00:15.470
It's like Docker, ensuring that each project has its own dependencies and packages and dependent of

00:15.470 --> 00:16.160
others.

00:16.520 --> 00:22.220
First step we will verify the installation of Python three via the command Python 3-V.

00:24.170 --> 00:25.580
Let's do that.

00:28.370 --> 00:34.040
Okay, I have the version 3.3 and this is the default version in my ubuntu.

00:34.490 --> 00:37.490
How can I change the default version?

00:38.030 --> 00:46.070
I can change the default version via this command sudo update alternatives dash dash config Python three.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.580
I have two version 3.1 and 3.3.

00:52.850 --> 00:57.170
We will continue with this version 3.13.

01:03.030 --> 01:13.830
Next step we will install virtual environment via the command sudo apt get install python the same version

01:13.920 --> 01:18.810
in the same default version virtual env.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.550
Let's install the virtual environment.

01:23.580 --> 01:27.450
I will change the version.

01:33.150 --> 01:36.690
Okay, the virtual environment was successfully installed.

01:38.280 --> 01:48.150
Next step we will create our first virtual environment via the command python3 m virtual environment.

01:48.180 --> 01:52.110
My working directory and the name of the virtual environment.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.890
Let's verify the creation stopped.

02:05.250 --> 02:05.910
Okay.

02:05.940 --> 02:09.760
The word environment was successfully created.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.970
Next step will activate the via the command source.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.890
My first virtual environment.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.310
That means the the name of my virtual environment.

02:21.340 --> 02:21.610
Slash.

02:21.640 --> 02:21.820
Bin.

02:21.820 --> 02:22.090
Slash.

02:22.090 --> 02:22.810
Activate.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.530
No such file or directory.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.660
Okay, I will fix the path.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.720
And the virtual environment was activated.

02:43.960 --> 02:49.690
We will do two two example to understand more how works with the virtual environment.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.690
The first example we will create a file hello P Greg.

02:52.690 --> 02:57.850
And after that we will run via the command python3.

02:57.850 --> 03:01.300
And the second example we will install Django.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.700
Let's start by the first example.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.870
I clear the screen.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.810
Hello, Greg.

03:25.100 --> 03:30.200
I execute my file in my virtual environment.

03:32.300 --> 03:32.990
Okay.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.400
Hello, world.

03:34.430 --> 03:37.100
Next we will install Django.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.820
In this virtual environment.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.790
Django was successfully installed.

03:50.810 --> 03:52.940
After working with the virtual environment.

03:52.940 --> 03:56.780
We can deactivate it via the command.

04:00.050 --> 04:01.100
Deactivate.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.720
And the virtual environment was successfully deactivated.
