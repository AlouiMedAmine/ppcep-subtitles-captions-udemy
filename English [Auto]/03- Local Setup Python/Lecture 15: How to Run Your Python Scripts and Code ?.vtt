00:00.200 --> 00:02.810
How to run your Python scripts and code.

00:02.810 --> 00:05.390
We will see together some methods to run Python.

00:05.390 --> 00:13.340
Let's start by the first method a run Python scripts from your operating system, command line or terminal.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.640
First, using the Python command we will create a file.

00:16.670 --> 00:17.870
Hello Greg.

00:18.950 --> 00:22.880
We will write first line print hello world.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.270
After that we will use Python to execute our file.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.920
Let's do the first example.

00:28.340 --> 00:30.260
We will create the file hello world.

00:31.790 --> 00:32.330
The file.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.410
Hello Greg.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.410
We will write print hello world.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.820
And we will execute that via Python command.

00:51.350 --> 00:55.400
For me I use Python three okay.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.430
And this is the execution after that.

00:59.750 --> 01:06.860
Second using the scripts file name directly on Linux and Mac, you can also run your scripts directly.

01:08.150 --> 01:10.760
Let's do this test.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.190
Because I'm working on ubuntu.

01:18.650 --> 01:19.520
Permission denied.

01:19.550 --> 01:19.850
Why?

01:20.840 --> 01:23.540
First of all, this file is not executable.

01:24.140 --> 01:25.520
Let's verify that.

01:32.270 --> 01:32.810
Okay.

01:32.840 --> 01:38.000
There is permission of read write but not executable.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.160
We will update.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.190
And adding the execution mode.

01:57.110 --> 01:57.620
Okay.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.480
The execution mode is added.

02:01.610 --> 02:03.470
Let's execute the file again.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.570
There is another problem.

02:11.570 --> 02:12.470
Why?

02:15.670 --> 02:19.990
After running this command cash mode, your help file will be executable.

02:20.020 --> 02:23.020
However, that's not enough for the script to run properly.

02:23.050 --> 02:23.740
Why?

02:23.770 --> 02:29.650
The problem is that your operating system for ubuntu doesn't know which program to use for running your

02:29.650 --> 02:33.280
script, and it's trying to run it with the shell itself.

02:35.410 --> 02:43.390
This is a Python program, and we can not run a Python program via shell, but via Python.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.690
To fix this problem, we will add this line.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.110
In our script.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.860
Let's try again.

03:18.970 --> 03:19.360
Okay.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.230
It works.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.410
Third method.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.290
Running models with the flag M.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.490
Flag m.

03:33.490 --> 03:34.420
That's mean.

03:34.450 --> 03:34.930
Hello.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.320
It.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.500
It will be considered as a model.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.150
Let's do the test.

03:44.410 --> 03:47.590
Python 3-M.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.000
Hello.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.400
Okay.

03:54.370 --> 03:59.710
After that, we execute Python code and the script is in interactive mode.

04:03.700 --> 04:08.440
Let's do an example with interactive mode.

04:08.470 --> 04:09.310
Python three.

04:10.060 --> 04:10.570
Okay.

04:14.290 --> 04:14.800
Print.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.490
Hello, world.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.050
Okay.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.580
This is the interactive mode.

04:38.250 --> 04:48.030
Next, using online editor, you can use online editor to do some test for Python.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.570
There are a lot of online editor.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.600
This is one of this editor.

04:54.630 --> 04:55.440
Print.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.130
After that we execute.

05:07.050 --> 05:07.380
Print.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.160
Hello, world.

05:09.210 --> 05:11.160
There are a lot a lot of.

05:13.710 --> 05:14.820
Online editor.

05:15.900 --> 05:20.040
And you can use it to do some tests with Python.

05:23.910 --> 05:32.820
D you can use any code editor to run your Python script, and you will see that on the next video.
