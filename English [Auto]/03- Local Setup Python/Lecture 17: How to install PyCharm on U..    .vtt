How to install PyCharm on ubuntu.

00:02.420 --> 00:04.280
But before that, what is PyCharm?

00:04.310 --> 00:08.660
PyCharm is an IDE integrated development environment.

00:08.960 --> 00:16.010
It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building testing,

00:16.010 --> 00:20.870
version control, integration, debugger, and other benefits.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.870
Some IDE used to run Python.

00:24.590 --> 00:29.090
We have Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, atom, PyCharm.

00:32.150 --> 00:40.790
We have Visual Studio Code used to run JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java and other programming

00:40.790 --> 00:41.330
language.

00:42.140 --> 00:47.240
Sublime text, atom and in our case P sharp.

00:47.450 --> 00:55.010
We will use the Community Edition and it is available for Linux, for Mac and for windows.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.080
Let's install PyCharm.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.140
There are two method to install PyCharm on ubuntu.

01:03.170 --> 01:08.750
First method via command line and the second via graphical user interface.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.370
We will use the first method.

01:12.110 --> 01:13.700
We will run this command.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.940
I will run again.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.920
But for me, I just installed.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.440
PyCharm community is already installed.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.750
Let's go to PyCharm.

01:33.610 --> 01:39.940
This is my first project Python for beginners and I can create a new project here.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.460
I will create my first file.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.790
Hello pig!

02:02.170 --> 02:02.530
Print.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.280
Hello world.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.930
I will execute here.

02:11.140 --> 02:12.490
And the execution.

02:12.490 --> 02:13.150
The result.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.050
Hello world.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.690
Settings to see what version of Python.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.750
Python interpreter.

02:28.570 --> 02:34.000
I used the latest version of Python 3.13.

02:36.010 --> 02:36.580
Okay.
