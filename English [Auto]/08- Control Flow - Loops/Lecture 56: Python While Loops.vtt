Hi everyone.

00:01.160 --> 00:08.450
Today we will start the section eight control Flow loops and we will start by learning while loops with

00:08.450 --> 00:14.480
the while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true here.

00:14.480 --> 00:22.850
In this example, while I less than seven print, I just note remember to increment I or else the loop

00:22.850 --> 00:24.230
will continue forever.

00:25.310 --> 00:29.600
With the break statement, we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.

00:29.630 --> 00:34.100
Here the condition that I is less than seven.

00:34.100 --> 00:42.200
But if I equal three, we will use the statement break and will exit the loop.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.630
With the continue statement.

00:44.630 --> 00:52.610
We can stop the current iteration and continue with the next here, while if I equal three, I will

00:52.610 --> 00:55.700
continue to the next iteration and I will not print three.

00:57.260 --> 01:04.640
We just see that else statement used with the if statement, but also it can be used with while loop.

01:04.670 --> 01:08.910
When this condition is not verified, we will pass to the else statement.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.120
Let's go to PyCharm and run some code.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.590
Here I execute the debugger mode.

01:20.880 --> 01:27.870
I take the value one here while I less than seven I continue to print I.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.220
Let's execute.

01:29.250 --> 01:34.260
I take 1234.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.260
Six.

01:38.190 --> 01:41.490
In the console I just.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.850
Print the value six.

01:51.570 --> 01:56.940
In the next iteration, the condition will not be verified and will exit the loop.

01:58.260 --> 02:04.380
Okay, let's execute the second example the break statement.

02:08.490 --> 02:11.760
I continue the execution.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.030
I take one next?

02:18.350 --> 02:19.490
I take two.

02:23.780 --> 02:24.980
I take three.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.190
If I equal three, we will execute the statement break.

02:31.940 --> 02:40.490
And in this case, we will exit from the while we just print until the value three and we will pass

02:40.490 --> 02:41.780
to the next example.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.550
The continue statement.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.050
I take the value zero.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.420
Let's execute.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.200
I take the value one.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.150
Take the value two.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.510
Take the value three.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.830
The condition is verified.

03:03.830 --> 03:04.550
We'll continue.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.060
Will pass to the line.

03:08.060 --> 03:08.810
Continue.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.510
We will not print.

03:11.870 --> 03:13.460
We will not execute this line.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.470
We will pass to the next iteration.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.250
Will print four.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.010
We don't print the line.

03:26.700 --> 03:33.120
The index three because we used the keyword.

03:33.120 --> 03:33.840
Continue.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.450
Let's continue the execution of code.

03:41.610 --> 03:44.520
And the last example the else statement.

03:46.650 --> 03:49.380
We will execute this line of code.

03:50.550 --> 03:54.330
When this condition is not more available.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.330
I continue to print until I take the value seven.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.030
I take the value six.

04:07.320 --> 04:12.660
The condition is not verified and we will execute the else statement.

04:16.770 --> 04:19.260
I is no longer less than seven.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.580
In the next video we will see how to use the for loop.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.860
And that's it for this video.
