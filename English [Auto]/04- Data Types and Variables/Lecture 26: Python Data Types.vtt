Hi everyone.

00:01.280 --> 00:04.640
In programming, data type is an important concept.

00:04.850 --> 00:10.100
Variables can store data of different types and different types can do different things.

00:10.790 --> 00:16.160
Python has the following data type built in by default in this categories.

00:16.640 --> 00:24.260
Text type is an str numeric types like int float, complex sequence types like list, tuple, range

00:24.290 --> 00:29.270
mapping type, dictionary set, types set, and frozenset.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.560
Here what is the difference between set and Frozenset set?

00:34.160 --> 00:38.990
It can be modified by adding or removing some element.

00:38.990 --> 00:43.310
Frozenset is immutable and cannot be changed after creation.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.110
Boolean type.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.630
Binary type and known type.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.800
To get the data type, we use the function type.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.880
In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable.

00:58.910 --> 01:08.750
Because like we said, Python is a dynamically programming language x take the value hello world.

01:08.750 --> 01:16.790
That mean x is the type S tier x, take the value 20 x is an int, and there are a lot of examples.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.970
X is a dictionary.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.090
Here X is a set.

01:23.870 --> 01:26.030
Here x takes the value true.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.280
That's mean x is a boolean.

01:30.440 --> 01:38.630
In some of these variables, we need to require to use a constructor to define the variable like byte

01:38.660 --> 01:40.700
array or memory view.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.200
But in the other case like str int float complex list, we can assign.

01:48.260 --> 01:51.590
The data type is set when you assign a value to a variable.

01:51.620 --> 01:57.590
But also we can use a constructor like in the fourth section.

01:58.610 --> 02:02.870
If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor function.

02:02.900 --> 02:03.800
Functions.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.980
Here, to define an str, we use the constructor.

02:07.010 --> 02:13.790
STR str hello world constructor int for int float complex list tuple range.

02:15.110 --> 02:17.030
And there are a lot of examples.

02:17.030 --> 02:20.480
Let's try some of these examples.

02:22.010 --> 02:23.510
I go to the PyCharm.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.390
The section Python Data types.

02:34.060 --> 02:39.100
We have a lot of examples here x take hello world and we print the type of x.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.660
It will be s tier x.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.320
Take the value 20 and the type it will be class int.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.570
Let's execute the code.

02:49.150 --> 02:53.110
Here for example x take apple banana cherry and the type.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.120
It will be a set.

02:59.140 --> 03:00.370
It will be a tuple.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.930
This is the dictionary.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.050
And this is the set.

03:16.450 --> 03:18.340
Define it with curly bracket.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.080
Cherry.

03:20.080 --> 03:20.500
Banana.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.220
Apple.

03:22.270 --> 03:22.810
True.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.890
It's a boolean.

03:25.420 --> 03:33.250
And also we can use constructor to define our variable like str int float and float.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.320
We have a lot of examples.
