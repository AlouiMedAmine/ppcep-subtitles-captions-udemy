00:00.140 --> 00:03.380
In this video we were exploring Python variables.

00:03.380 --> 00:08.180
Think of variables as containers for storing data values in Python.

00:08.180 --> 00:12.170
Creating a variable is simple as assigning a value to it.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.580
Here is an example.

00:13.580 --> 00:20.690
In this code, x is a variable that holds the number five, which is an integer, and y is a variable

00:20.690 --> 00:23.960
that holds textjoin, which is a string.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.330
Let's execute the first example.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.310
I use the debugger mode.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.140
I add a breakpoint.

00:31.820 --> 00:37.820
We can see the result in console, and we can see the variable via this window.

00:40.550 --> 00:46.790
X is a variable that holds the number five, which is an integer.

00:49.400 --> 00:59.510
Y is a variable that holds Joan, which is an austere I print x.

00:59.510 --> 01:07.030
Print y in the console x five and y is zone.

01:08.530 --> 01:11.470
Python doesn't need especially command to declare a.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.400
Variables.

01:12.430 --> 01:14.890
Variables in Python are dynamic.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.590
They don't need to be a specific type and can change type even after being set.

01:21.070 --> 01:25.180
Here x starts as an integer with value four.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.570
Then change to a string with the value Charlie.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.960
Let's try this example x.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.270
Take the the value for.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.420
X take the value four.

01:41.350 --> 01:42.940
I print the result.

01:45.070 --> 01:49.480
After that x take Sally as an str.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.610
Let's see the variable x.

01:55.390 --> 02:03.400
X take the value sally which is an str and we print the result in the console.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.350
Which is next.

02:08.380 --> 02:14.050
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with with casting.

02:16.030 --> 02:23.110
Here x is defined as str, y is defined as int and z is defined as float.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.300
Let's execute this example.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.190
Here x it will be in str.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.430
Variables.

02:36.310 --> 02:39.070
X str three.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.890
Next y it will be int.

02:45.220 --> 02:46.840
And z it will be float.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.950
And you can see the result here.

02:54.580 --> 03:02.470
X is an estimate y is an int and z is a float.

03:03.010 --> 03:07.420
If you want to know the type of a variable, use the type function.

03:07.420 --> 03:07.560
Sanction.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.250
We will continue with the same example.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.050
Here x take a next year.

03:16.050 --> 03:20.010
Y take an int and z take a float.

03:20.490 --> 03:23.490
Let's verify the type of each variable.

03:27.690 --> 03:30.570
I select the the window variables.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.060
X its class str y its class int and z.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.650
It will be class float.

03:51.570 --> 03:53.370
There is another example x.

03:53.370 --> 04:00.000
Take five as an integer and y take a zone as a.

04:00.030 --> 04:06.270
Next year, let's see together the type of these two variables.

04:09.240 --> 04:14.300
X it will be class int and y it will be class str.

04:20.630 --> 04:25.730
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.

04:26.180 --> 04:35.360
Here x is defined with double quotes, and here x is defined with a single quote and there is no difference

04:35.360 --> 04:37.340
between these two syntax.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.230
Let's try that.

04:40.550 --> 04:43.760
Here we have x defined with double quote.

04:47.600 --> 04:47.930
Five.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.480
Single or double quote.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.070
Section five x defined with double quote.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.990
The type of x is str.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.740
Next x is defined with single quote.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.420
And the same type str.

05:16.100 --> 05:16.730
Six.

05:16.730 --> 05:20.900
Remember that variable's name in Python are case sensitive.

05:20.930 --> 05:21.620
That's mean.

05:21.620 --> 05:25.190
Lowercase and uppercase are different variables.

05:25.940 --> 05:35.750
In this example, lowercase a holds the integer four and the uppercase A holds the string sally, and

05:35.780 --> 05:39.050
the uppercase will not override the lowercase.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.450
Let's execute this example.

05:43.160 --> 05:53.450
Six case sensitive A takes lowercase, a takes the number four and the uppercase take the number.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.000
Take the steer.

05:56.030 --> 05:56.630
Sally.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.460
Let's print the two result.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.230
Lowercase a.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.800
Take the value four and the uppercase A.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.990
Take the steer.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.530
Sally.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.900
There are two variables.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.820
Two different variables.
