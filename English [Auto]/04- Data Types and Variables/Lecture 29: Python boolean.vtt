Hi everyone!

00:01.400 --> 00:03.830
Today we will learn Python booleans.

00:03.920 --> 00:07.310
Booleans represent one of two values true or false.

00:07.790 --> 00:12.140
You can evaluate any expression in Python and get one of two answers.

00:13.820 --> 00:19.700
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the boolean answer here.

00:19.700 --> 00:27.380
For example, print ten is greater than nine will return true, then equal to nine return false and

00:27.380 --> 00:29.750
ten less than nine return false.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.700
This is another example.

00:32.540 --> 00:35.930
The result it will be B is not greater than A.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.210
We can evaluate values and variables via the function bool.

00:42.440 --> 00:51.770
For example, here we evaluate the string hello with the function bool and the result will be true also

00:51.770 --> 00:53.990
for the second, it will be true.

00:56.570 --> 00:58.070
Most values are true.

00:58.100 --> 01:03.860
Almost any value is evaluated to true if it has some sort of content.

01:03.860 --> 01:06.380
Any string is true except empty strings.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.510
Any number is true except zero.

01:08.540 --> 01:13.070
Any list, tuple, set, and dictionaries are true except empty one.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.280
Here the following will return true.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.710
Some values are false.

01:18.770 --> 01:25.310
In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to false except empty values such as empty list,

01:25.340 --> 01:27.260
empty dictionary, and empty set.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.890
The number zero also and the value are known.

01:33.020 --> 01:39.200
Here we will execute all this example and all will return false.

01:40.670 --> 01:43.250
We can also evaluate an object.

01:43.250 --> 01:47.870
When evaluate an object, we will see the result of the magic function length.

01:47.900 --> 01:55.730
If it return zero or false, the result of bool Myobject it will return false.

01:57.440 --> 02:05.850
In Python, we can create a function that return a boolean and also we can use this function in an if

02:05.850 --> 02:06.660
statement here.

02:06.660 --> 02:13.110
For example, if my function returns true, I print yes or else I print no.

02:13.530 --> 02:23.130
There are a lot of other functions that return boolean like is instance, which can be used to determine

02:23.130 --> 02:25.980
if an object is of a certain data type.

02:26.010 --> 02:33.330
Here, for example, is instance x is and x is 200 and the result will be true.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.780
Let's execute some of this example in PyCharm.

02:37.380 --> 02:44.730
I use the debugger mode and let's do line by line.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.830
Here the result will be true.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.710
The second it will be false and then less than nine it will be false.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.990
Here the result will be B is not greater than A.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.330
The result of print bool.

03:06.360 --> 03:06.690
Hello.

03:06.690 --> 03:07.140
Return.

03:07.170 --> 03:07.530
True.

03:07.560 --> 03:13.170
Because this string is not empty and also this line will return true.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.590
The result of three line of code.

03:19.590 --> 03:25.590
It will be return true, not empty string and not empty list.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.380
Some values are false like the boolean.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.270
The the value false.

03:33.270 --> 03:34.320
No zero.

03:34.350 --> 03:35.190
Empty string.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.120
Empty list.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.980
All value are false.

03:39.960 --> 03:51.030
Like we said, when try to evaluate an object, we will see the result of the magic magic function length.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.560
If it returns zero or false, the result will be false.

03:55.800 --> 04:01.770
Here in this case the return zero, and here the result will be false.

04:08.620 --> 04:12.670
Like we said in Python, we can create a function that returns a boolean.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.460
Here this function returns true.

04:17.710 --> 04:18.190
Result.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.090
It will be true.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.170
We can.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.620
Test this function in an if statement like in this example.

04:26.650 --> 04:30.670
Here my function returns true and the result will be yes.

04:32.260 --> 04:32.590
Print.

04:32.590 --> 04:33.190
Yes.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.840
There are a lot of functions that return boolean.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.370
When of this function.

04:39.370 --> 04:41.260
The function is instance.

04:41.380 --> 04:46.480
To verify if x have the type int or no.

04:47.020 --> 04:52.660
In this case x, take the value 200 and the result will be true.

04:56.170 --> 05:02.890
Congratulations, you just learn Python booleans and just judge it for this video.
