00:00.230 --> 00:02.780
Python variable names in Python.

00:02.780 --> 00:06.080
You can name your variables almost anything you like.

00:06.110 --> 00:13.400
It can have a short name like x and y, or a more descriptive name like age, car name, total volume.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.800
But there are some rules we need to follow.

00:15.830 --> 00:21.560
Rule number one A variable name must start with the letter or the underscore character.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.370
Rule number two A variable name cannot start with a number.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.940
Rule number three A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.620
A to z 0 to 9 and underscore.

00:37.580 --> 00:38.690
Rule number four.

00:38.720 --> 00:42.470
Variable names are case sensitive and her age.

00:42.470 --> 00:45.860
Lowercase and uppercase are different variables.

00:46.220 --> 00:54.740
And finally, rule number five a variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords like if else while

00:54.770 --> 00:58.250
pass continue because there are a Python reserved words.

00:58.430 --> 01:02.960
Let's see some legal and illegal variable names.

01:05.330 --> 01:05.570
Here.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.660
The first variable contains just a letter.

01:08.690 --> 01:11.870
The second contain an underscore at the middle.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.860
the third.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.170
It can start with the underscore.

01:15.950 --> 01:20.660
The fourth variable contain lowercase and uppercase.

01:21.530 --> 01:24.920
The five variable just uppercase.

01:25.430 --> 01:30.380
And here the last variable contain a number at the end and at the middle.

01:32.180 --> 01:39.830
Let's see some illegal variable names first, because start with the number variable cannot start with

01:39.830 --> 01:43.010
a number, but it can start with the underscore.

01:44.330 --> 01:53.150
The second because contain a hyphen and it's considered by Python like an operator, like a multiplication

01:53.150 --> 01:55.820
or a plus operator.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.450
And the third because contain space.

02:03.410 --> 02:06.290
Remember that variable names are case sensitive.

02:06.290 --> 02:13.580
And here age with lowercase and uppercase are a different variable.

02:13.730 --> 02:19.070
Let's see that I execute only this part of code via PyCharm.

02:19.490 --> 02:23.410
I select the part of code which I Executed.

02:24.550 --> 02:27.430
Execute selection in Python console.

02:28.630 --> 02:33.850
Here there are three variables and each variable contains a different value.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.750
Ten, 11 and 12.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.610
Next multi words.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.870
Multi words.

02:43.870 --> 02:45.160
Variable names.

02:45.190 --> 02:49.150
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.260
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.270
First camel case.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.550
Each word except the first start with a capital letter, except the first.

03:01.060 --> 03:04.210
Each word starts with a capital letter.

03:04.930 --> 03:08.530
The second each word starts with a capital letter.

03:08.530 --> 03:14.080
Even the first and third snake case.

03:14.110 --> 03:17.890
Each word is separated by an underscore character.

03:18.130 --> 03:26.410
Here we have three words, and between each word we add an underscore character.

03:27.190 --> 03:30.550
Now you know how to name your variables in Python.

03:30.550 --> 03:34.900
And in the next video we will see how assign multiple value.
