Python syntax.

00:01.640 --> 00:06.470
Now let's look at the rules for writing Python, starting with indentation.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.670
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.970
In Python, indentation is very important.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.330
In this example, we have an if statement with the second line print five is greater than two.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.630
The second line is indented with four spaces.

00:23.660 --> 00:29.180
This indentation tells Python that the second line is part of the if statement.

00:29.210 --> 00:36.110
If you skip the indentation, Python will throw a syntax error or read them as two different statements.

00:36.980 --> 00:39.590
Let's try the first and the second example.

00:41.150 --> 00:42.680
The result of print.

00:42.980 --> 00:48.950
But if we skip the indentation, Python will throw a syntax error.

00:50.210 --> 00:57.920
You can use different number of spaces, but the standard is for can be one or more.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.040
But the standard is four.

01:11.870 --> 01:16.430
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.220
Otherwise Python will give you an error.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.920
Let's try this example.

01:24.290 --> 01:30.770
Here we have an if statement with two lines, and the two lines have the same indentation.

01:31.250 --> 01:35.870
If you change one of them, Python will throw a syntax error.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.280
Just make sure you are consistent with the same block.
