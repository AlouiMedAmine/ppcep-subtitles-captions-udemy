00:00.140 --> 00:01.130
Hi everyone.

00:01.130 --> 00:03.560
In this video we learn Python numbers.

00:03.590 --> 00:05.990
There are three numeric types in Python.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.240
Int, float and complex.

00:09.290 --> 00:14.570
Like we know, variable of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.

00:14.570 --> 00:26.330
X is an int because take one, y is a float because take 2.8 and z is a complex with the symbol J.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.630
To verify the type of any object in Python, we use always the type function.

00:32.630 --> 00:36.260
We will see in details each of this type.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.970
Let's start by int.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.730
Int or integer is a whole number positive or negative, without decimal of unlimited length.

00:43.730 --> 00:48.620
It can be positive or negative without unlimited of length.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.460
Why?

00:50.090 --> 00:57.980
Because there are programming languages like Java for example an int it have a max value and mean value.

01:00.250 --> 01:06.460
Float or floating point number, is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals,

01:06.730 --> 01:07.720
like here x.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.930
Take the value 1.10 y take the value 1.0.

01:15.460 --> 01:24.040
We can also specify a float with the letter e uppercase or lowercase like in this example.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.900
This is a float.

01:26.740 --> 01:30.610
A complex number are written with a j letters.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.690
It can be positive or negative.

01:37.300 --> 01:42.460
You can convert from one type to another with the method int, float and complex.

01:42.460 --> 01:49.930
For example, we can convert from n to float with the method float from float to int with the method

01:49.930 --> 01:58.330
int and we can convert also float and int to the complex with the method complex.

01:58.330 --> 02:03.420
But be sure that you cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

02:03.810 --> 02:04.950
In the section five.

02:04.980 --> 02:10.170
Python does not have a random function to make a random number, but Python has a built in.

02:10.710 --> 02:15.390
Module called random that can be used to make random numbers.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.300
Random is not a function.

02:19.020 --> 02:25.170
In Python, but for example Java, we have a method random in the class Java.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.890
Long dot math.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.710
Why I said method and not a function?

02:34.710 --> 02:36.480
Because a method is always.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.720
Associated to an object to an object.

02:40.650 --> 02:43.800
And this is the difference between method and function.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.340
And.

02:44.520 --> 02:54.870
Here we use the import the module random and we call the function randrange to to make.

02:54.900 --> 02:55.830
A random number.

02:55.860 --> 02:59.730
Let's do some examples to understand more.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.160
By the numbers.

03:05.690 --> 03:09.290
Here we have a lot of example x here defined as int.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.150
Let's execute our code.

03:11.180 --> 03:13.040
I execute the debugger mode.

03:17.390 --> 03:20.540
Let's start by the the first Python numbers.

03:21.860 --> 03:26.210
X take the value of int y.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.690
Take the value of float and z take the value of complex.

03:30.740 --> 03:35.480
To know the type of any object in Python, we use the function type.

03:36.350 --> 03:44.480
And when we see the console, it will be int for the x, float for the y and complex for g.

03:47.390 --> 03:53.150
A number n can be positive or negative and without and unlimited number.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.350
And three.

04:01.860 --> 04:10.320
Three examples x, y and z are type of int air float contain a decimal.

04:16.170 --> 04:24.780
And this is the the type float for each of this example, with the type function in the console, we

04:24.780 --> 04:26.430
show that the class float.

04:27.630 --> 04:28.440
In class.

04:28.440 --> 04:34.140
We can define also a float with the letter E uppercase or lowercase.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.450
Let's see the variable.

04:39.120 --> 04:47.310
X is a float, y is a float also, and z is a float in the console.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.670
All the class are float type conversion.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.190
We can convert from into float.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.100
But before that the type complex.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.660
And we see that in the console.

05:03.290 --> 05:06.770
All these types are complex with the symbol J.

05:08.210 --> 05:16.340
We can convert into float float to int or int float to complex with the method int float and complex.

05:17.390 --> 05:20.390
Here we define a as a float.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.750
And we convert we type of.

05:37.070 --> 05:37.910
We change.

05:37.910 --> 05:39.920
We convert from float to int.

05:46.730 --> 05:51.110
The old value is 22.8.

05:51.110 --> 05:55.490
And after we convert that to int the result it will be only two.

05:58.580 --> 05:59.770
X is an int.

06:01.660 --> 06:08.110
We can convert into complex where we have x is one.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.840
We convert to complex.

06:13.810 --> 06:17.920
And it will be one plus zero j.

06:19.540 --> 06:26.530
We use the modular random to make a random number between 1 to 9.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.750
They give the number one.

06:34.960 --> 06:41.530
Just be sure that the float is defined with the point number or with the scientific number with the

06:41.530 --> 06:49.780
letter e lowercase or uppercase to indicate that the number is a power of ten.

06:49.810 --> 06:56.710
For example, here 35 it will be multiplied by ten.

06:57.430 --> 07:03.540
Power three here by ten power four, and here by ten power 100.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.390
Let's verify the result of this.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.310
Three variables.

07:08.520 --> 07:13.020
Because I don't mention that at the beginning of this video.

07:13.470 --> 07:14.070
Here.

07:14.370 --> 07:18.840
Here we have 35 multiplied by ten power.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.540
Three by 1000.

07:21.540 --> 07:25.140
And why it multiplied by 10,000.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.170
E power e four.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.040
That's mean ten.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.840
Power 4E3.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.670
That's mean ten.

07:32.670 --> 07:33.630
Power three.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.890
Multiplied by the first part of this number.

07:42.150 --> 07:51.840
Also remember that we can convert from int to float from float to int also from float and int to complex.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.160
But we cannot convert from complex to int or float.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.080
And that's it for this video.
