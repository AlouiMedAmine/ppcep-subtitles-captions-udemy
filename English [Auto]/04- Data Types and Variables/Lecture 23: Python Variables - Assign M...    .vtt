Hi everyone.

00:01.310 --> 00:05.720
In this video we will see how to assign multiple values in Python.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.570
First, we will start by assigning many values to multiple variables in the same line.

00:12.290 --> 00:15.890
Here we have three variables and three values.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.150
Each variable take values in the same order.

00:20.180 --> 00:25.100
X will take the orange, and z will take the last value.

00:25.130 --> 00:27.050
Let's execute this example.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.790
I execute this part of code execute selection.

00:37.070 --> 00:43.610
Here we have three variables x, y, and z, and each variable take a value.

00:48.350 --> 00:54.230
Here make sure the number of variables match the number of values or Python will throw an error.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.850
Let's try that.

00:55.880 --> 01:02.450
If, for example, I have just two variables, Let's execute the code.

01:04.220 --> 01:05.930
Python will throw an error.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.700
Too many values to unpack.

01:07.730 --> 01:08.780
Expected two.

01:09.590 --> 01:14.330
Because here we have three values, but only for two variables.

01:17.990 --> 01:22.100
The same when I have more variables.

01:22.490 --> 01:25.160
For example, I add another variables.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.660
I execute the code.

01:35.030 --> 01:36.860
Not enough value to unpack.

01:36.890 --> 01:37.880
Expected four.

01:37.910 --> 01:38.690
Got three.

01:40.970 --> 01:41.870
Expected four.

01:41.900 --> 01:48.740
That mean I expected four values because I have four variables.

01:52.430 --> 01:58.160
Remember to be sure that the number of variables match the number of values.

01:58.610 --> 02:04.160
Next How to assign one value to multiple variables.

02:04.790 --> 02:08.780
You can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.600
Here, for example, we have three variables.

02:11.630 --> 02:14.090
Assign it to only one values.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.040
Let's execute this example.

02:23.330 --> 02:27.290
Here x, y, and z are all.

02:27.290 --> 02:30.890
The variable has the same value orange.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.800
Third, we will see how to unpack a collection.

02:36.830 --> 02:41.870
A collection it can be a list a set a tuple a dictionary.

02:41.900 --> 02:46.370
Python allows you to extract the value into variables.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.790
Let's try this example.

02:51.890 --> 02:56.120
Here we have a list with three elements and we have three variables.

03:02.620 --> 03:10.450
Here each variable take values x, take an apple, Y take banana and Zetec cherry.

03:11.080 --> 03:11.470
Same.

03:11.470 --> 03:13.150
If for example, we have.

03:15.220 --> 03:24.940
Four variables that mean the number of variables it's bigger than the number of list.

03:26.650 --> 03:28.660
Let's execute this part of code.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.750
Python will throw an error.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.640
Not enough value to unpack.

03:36.670 --> 03:37.630
Expected four.

03:37.660 --> 03:47.650
Good three because we have four variables and in the list we have just three elements.

03:49.840 --> 03:58.000
Thus mean the number of variable must be the same the number of the list of or the dictionary.

03:58.840 --> 04:03.760
In this example we use the list, but it can be a tuple.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.420
We will have the same result.

04:17.740 --> 04:23.410
Each variable take a value and also it can be a set or a dictionary.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.810
The same result.

04:38.770 --> 04:42.550
We will see more detail about collection in other videos.

04:42.550 --> 04:50.170
We will see more detail about lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries with a lot of examples.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.970
Just a short summary.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.420
In this video we just see how to assign multiple variables, how to assign single value to multiple

04:58.420 --> 05:01.900
variables, and third, how to unpack a collection.
