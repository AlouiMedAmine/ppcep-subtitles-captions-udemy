Hi everyone.

00:01.220 --> 00:04.790
Today we will learn assignment operators in Python.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.700
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables equal.

00:10.700 --> 00:15.320
That mean we will assign a value to this variable plus equal.

00:15.380 --> 00:21.530
It's like x equal x plus three minus equal or multiplication equal.

00:21.860 --> 00:25.910
There are a lot of operator assignment operators.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.590
Let's do some examples.

00:29.810 --> 00:31.850
I use the debugger mode.

00:37.370 --> 00:37.940
Equal.

00:37.940 --> 00:48.230
That mean we will assign the value five to the variable x addition plus equal subtraction.

00:48.230 --> 00:49.520
Multiplication.

00:51.050 --> 00:51.980
Division.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.210
Modulus.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.060
Floor division.

01:02.990 --> 01:03.860
Floor division.

01:03.860 --> 01:11.030
That mean without decimal and division, we will return a decimal.

01:11.450 --> 01:14.480
This is the difference between division and floor division.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.010
Exponentiation.
