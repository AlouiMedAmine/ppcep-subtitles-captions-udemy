Hi everyone.

00:01.340 --> 00:04.160
Today we will learn arithmetic operators.

00:04.760 --> 00:11.390
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations like addition,

00:11.390 --> 00:18.350
subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation and floor division.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.360
Let's do some examples.

00:23.270 --> 00:25.400
I execute via the debugger mode.

00:29.180 --> 00:33.500
X take the value five and y take the value three.

00:35.450 --> 00:36.620
Addition the value.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.760
It will be eight.

00:38.180 --> 00:38.960
Subtraction.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.590
It will be two division.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.760
This is the result.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.050
Modulus.

00:51.770 --> 00:53.180
Exponentiation.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.710
And finally floor division.
