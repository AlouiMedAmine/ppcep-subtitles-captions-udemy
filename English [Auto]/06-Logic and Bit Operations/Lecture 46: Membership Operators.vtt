Hi everyone, let's learn together.

00:02.450 --> 00:04.370
Python membership operators.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.280
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.440
We have two operators.

00:12.470 --> 00:15.710
The first operator in returns a true.

00:15.740 --> 00:19.610
If a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.

00:20.330 --> 00:27.410
The second operator, not in, returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in

00:27.410 --> 00:28.250
the object.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.280
Let's go to PyCharm and play with some code.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.600
The operator in.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.840
Let's execute this code.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.310
The result.

00:40.310 --> 00:45.200
It will be true because the specified value is in the list.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.120
The result is true.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.430
The second operator not in.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.400
In this example.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.090
The result.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.770
It will be also true.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.280
Why?

00:58.310 --> 01:02.000
Because this specified value is not in the list.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.170
And that's it for this video.
