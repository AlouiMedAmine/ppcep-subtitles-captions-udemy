Hi everyone!

00:01.250 --> 00:04.910
In this video we will learn logical operators in Python.

00:04.940 --> 00:09.020
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

00:09.020 --> 00:17.480
We have three operators and returns true if both statements are true or returns true if one of the statements

00:17.480 --> 00:23.240
is true and not reverse the result and returns false if the result is true.

00:23.270 --> 00:26.060
Let's execute some examples in PyCharm.

00:27.380 --> 00:27.980
Here x.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.220
Take the value five is greater than three and less than ten.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.330
True and true.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.010
The result it will be true.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.490
X is greater than three but is not less than four.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.370
We have the first statement return true.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.050
The result it will be true.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.370
Just when statement returns true, the final result it will be true and not here in this example it

00:58.370 --> 00:59.330
will return.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.640
We will return false.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.240
Why?

01:02.270 --> 01:11.030
Because the expression the first expression returns true, and with the not operator it will return

01:11.030 --> 01:11.660
false.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.720
Result is false.

01:19.670 --> 01:22.310
Five is greater than three and less than ten.

01:22.850 --> 01:23.810
True and true.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.630
It will be true with the operator.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.370
Not we will have the result.

01:28.370 --> 01:28.970
False.
