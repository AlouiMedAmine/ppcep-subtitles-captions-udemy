00:00.080 --> 00:02.360
Hi everyone, let's learn together.

00:02.360 --> 00:04.460
Python identity operators.

00:04.520 --> 00:10.760
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not the are equal, but they are actually the same

00:10.790 --> 00:13.040
object with the same memory location.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.150
We have two operators is and is not is.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.690
Returns true if both variables are the same object.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.440
Is not.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.010
Returns true if both variables are not the same object.

00:25.010 --> 00:28.310
Let's go to PyCharm and execute some examples.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.920
Here we have two lists x and y with the same content.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.330
A third variable, z is assigned to variable x.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.180
Let's execute the code via debugger mode.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.450
The result here it will be true.

00:50.480 --> 00:50.870
Why?

00:50.900 --> 00:54.590
Because z and x are the same object.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.370
X is y.

01:02.330 --> 01:02.990
The result?

01:02.990 --> 01:07.850
It will be false because x and y are different objects.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.550
X equal to y.

01:14.060 --> 01:14.780
The result.

01:14.780 --> 01:17.090
It will be true because equal.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.810
Compare the content of two variables.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.640
Here we have the same content.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.320
The result it will be true.

01:26.480 --> 01:37.550
Like we see here, the difference between equal and is is compare between objects and reference and

01:37.550 --> 01:38.180
equal.

01:38.180 --> 01:42.380
Use it to compare between content of two variables.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.830
Let's continue this example.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.050
X is not z, it will return false.

01:51.050 --> 01:51.380
Why?

01:51.410 --> 01:54.620
Because there are same object.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.120
X is not y.

01:59.150 --> 02:05.570
It will return true because x and y are different objects.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.020
X is not y, it will return true.

02:15.050 --> 02:15.710
Why?

02:16.160 --> 02:19.850
Because x is not the same object as y.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.080
In this code, x is not equal to y.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.120
It will return false because x and y have the same content.

02:33.950 --> 02:44.210
Just remember that is is not the same like equal is used to compare between memory location and object

02:44.480 --> 02:45.020
equal.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.120
Use it to compare between content.

02:47.450 --> 02:48.860
And that's it for this video.
