Hi everyone!

00:01.400 --> 00:05.030
Today we will learn comparison operators in Python.

00:05.690 --> 00:09.200
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

00:10.160 --> 00:16.220
We have equal not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.900
Less than or equal to.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.610
Let's do some examples.

00:21.170 --> 00:24.290
I execute the code via the debugger mode.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.250
I select the console to see the result x.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.990
Take the value five y.

00:30.020 --> 00:34.700
Take the value three x equal to y.

00:34.820 --> 00:40.730
It will return false five five is different to three.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.260
It will return true.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.140
Five is greater than three.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.520
It will return true.

00:49.430 --> 00:52.790
X is less than y.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.350
It will return false.

00:55.160 --> 01:00.620
X is greater than or equal to to the value three.

01:00.650 --> 01:02.060
It will return true.

01:03.050 --> 01:09.140
And finally x is less than or equal to y.

01:09.140 --> 01:17.300
It will return false because x take the value five and not less than or equal to three.
