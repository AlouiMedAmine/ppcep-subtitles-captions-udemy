00:00.280 --> 00:01.400
Hi everyone!

00:01.880 --> 00:05.280
In this video we will learn how to add items in list.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.160
Let's start by the first section Append Items.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.680
To add an item to the end of the list, use the append method.

00:14.880 --> 00:20.560
Here we have a list which contains three items.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.800
This list append orange.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.120
Orange will be added at the end of the list.

00:26.720 --> 00:33.840
Second, insert items to insert a list item at a specific index, use the insert method.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.600
Here we have our list which contains three items.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.640
We insert orange at the index one.

00:41.920 --> 00:49.640
The new list will contain apple orange, which is inserted at the index one banana and cherry.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.920
The list will now contain four items Apple, orange, banana, and cherry.

00:55.680 --> 01:02.780
Section three extend list to append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend

01:02.780 --> 01:03.340
method.

01:03.740 --> 01:13.660
Here we define two Python lists and we will extend the first list which have the name this list with

01:13.780 --> 01:15.540
the second list tropical.

01:15.900 --> 01:16.820
The code is.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.900
This list extend tropical.

01:19.020 --> 01:25.780
The result will be apple, banana, cherry and after that the items of the second list.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.260
The length of the new list will be six.

01:29.420 --> 01:34.140
Section four add an iterable, always with the method extend.

01:34.940 --> 01:43.540
Here in the third section, we use extend with two lists, but it can be used also for any iterable

01:43.540 --> 01:47.060
object like tuples, sets, or dictionaries.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.620
Here we will add a tuple to our initial list.

01:52.260 --> 01:56.180
The result will be apple, banana, cherry, kiwi and orange.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.380
A new list with five items.

02:00.540 --> 02:03.840
Let's go to PyCharm and do some This is.

02:07.640 --> 02:11.120
First append items we use the method append.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.000
Let's execute the code and see the result.

02:17.800 --> 02:25.440
The new list contain four items and orange is added at the end of the list.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.840
Second insert items.

02:31.240 --> 02:37.920
We use the method insert, referring to the index number to add a new item to the list.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.680
Here we add orange at the index one.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.360
The new list will contain apple, orange, banana, and cherry.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.560
The length of the list will be four.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.880
Let's execute the code.

02:56.280 --> 03:03.680
The result is Apple orange, which is inserted at the index one after that, banana and

03:06.500 --> 03:08.100
Third extend list.

03:08.420 --> 03:15.300
We will extend our initial list by adding items from another list.

03:16.180 --> 03:24.340
Here the result it will be all items for the initial list and after that the items of the second list.

03:24.820 --> 03:27.420
Let's execute the code and see the result.

03:31.460 --> 03:41.020
The list now contain six items, three items for the initial list and after that the items of the second

03:41.060 --> 03:41.620
list.

03:41.900 --> 03:48.660
Mango and the other items always with the extend method.

03:49.780 --> 03:58.140
Here in the third section we use extend with two lists, but extend it can be used for any iterable.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.460
It can be sets.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.020
It can be tuple or others.

04:03.780 --> 04:09.040
Here in this example we will extend our initial list by a tuple.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.280
The result?

04:10.280 --> 04:16.840
It will be apple, banana, cherry and at the end the new two items Kiwi and orange.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.920
Let's execute the code and see the result.

04:26.480 --> 04:36.440
We have a new list which contain five items, three from the initial list and the last two items from

04:36.440 --> 04:37.160
the tuple.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.160
Let's do a small recap.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.520
We have three methods to add item in list.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.800
Two of them always.

04:45.920 --> 04:53.760
We add items at the end of the list via the method append and the method extend.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.000
Extend.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.680
It can be used for lists or any iterable like tuples dictionaries.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.120
The third method insert items.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.000
We insert item refer to the index number and that's it for this video.
