Hi everyone!

00:01.280 --> 00:05.060
In this video we will learn how to join lists in Python.

00:05.060 --> 00:09.770
There are several ways to join or concatenate two or more lists in Python.

00:09.770 --> 00:15.590
One of the easiest ways are by using the plus operator like here.

00:15.590 --> 00:20.840
In this example, with the plus operator, we concatenate list one to list two.

00:21.410 --> 00:28.640
Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list two into list one one by one.

00:29.510 --> 00:38.630
Here we iterate all elements in the list two, and we append each element to the list one.

00:39.980 --> 00:46.460
Or you can use the extend method, where the purpose is to add elements from one list to another list,

00:47.480 --> 00:55.010
like in this example, use the extend method to add list two at the end of list one, let's run some

00:55.010 --> 00:55.670
code.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.370
This is the first example using the plus operator.

01:06.020 --> 01:12.320
And we have the concatenation and the join of the list one and list two.

01:12.350 --> 01:15.770
The same operator using to concatenate string.

01:20.030 --> 01:25.070
The second example is to append each element from the list two to the list one.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.870
One by one.

01:33.290 --> 01:38.570
We iterate all elements from list two, and we add each element to the list one.

01:38.570 --> 01:39.680
One by one.

01:40.520 --> 01:46.160
We have the same result and the last method via the extend method.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.110
Let's execute that.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.810
Also, we have the same result.
