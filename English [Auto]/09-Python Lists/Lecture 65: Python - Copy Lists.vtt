00:00.480 --> 00:01.560
Hi everyone!

00:01.840 --> 00:04.880
In this video we will learn copy lists in Python.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.480
Let's start by small introduction.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.840
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list two.

00:10.880 --> 00:17.520
Equal list one, because list two will only be a reference to list one and the change is made in list

00:17.520 --> 00:20.880
one will automatically also be made in list two.

00:20.920 --> 00:26.240
Let's go to PyCharm and understand together these two lines.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.040
Here we have list one which contains three items.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.920
We assign list one to list two.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.600
Let's execute the code and see the result.

00:42.280 --> 00:49.000
With the operator assignment we have two Python list list one and list two, which contain the same

00:49.000 --> 00:49.640
items.

00:50.800 --> 00:57.120
If we can have two lists with the same items, only with the assignment operator.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.840
Why we need a copy.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.520
Let's continue with this code.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.000
We will update the second item in the list.

01:08.040 --> 01:08.360
Two.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.520
Let's execute the code and see the result.

01:18.760 --> 01:31.520
List two contain the new item orange in the index one, but also the list one is changed because list

01:31.520 --> 01:34.640
one and list two share the same allocation memory.

01:35.560 --> 01:43.080
For this reason, we need to use Python copy because with Python copy, each variable will be reference

01:43.080 --> 01:45.720
to a different list.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.920
Each variable have their own allocation memory.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.040
Let's learn together the introduction.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.360
You cannot copy a list simply by typing.

02:01.400 --> 02:08.050
List two equals list one because list two will only be a reference to list one, and the changes made

02:08.050 --> 02:11.850
in list one will automatically also be made in list two.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.610
Let's start by the first section.

02:14.610 --> 02:15.890
Use the copy method.

02:16.450 --> 02:21.610
You can use the building list method copy to copy a list here.

02:21.610 --> 02:25.050
In this example, we have a list with three items.

02:25.050 --> 02:29.530
We use the method copy to have a new copy of the list.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.690
Second, use the list method.

02:33.690 --> 02:38.530
List is a method or also is a constructor which can use it.

02:39.170 --> 02:43.170
To copy a Python list.

02:43.210 --> 02:51.690
We need to pass our initial list as a parameter in the constructor, or in the method list to have a

02:51.690 --> 02:52.930
new Python list.

02:55.130 --> 02:57.530
Section three use the slice operator.

02:57.890 --> 03:06.090
You can also make a copy of a list by using the slice operator when we don't specify the start value

03:06.210 --> 03:07.330
and the end value.

03:07.530 --> 03:10.170
We will take all the items of the list.

03:10.850 --> 03:16.250
Let's go to PyCharm and understand more each of this case.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.450
First copy a list using the method copy.

03:23.490 --> 03:26.090
We have our initial list.

03:26.890 --> 03:29.690
After that we execute the code.

03:29.690 --> 03:35.210
This list copy and we will have a new Python list.

03:37.290 --> 03:40.170
Let's execute this part of code.

03:42.490 --> 03:47.690
This is a copy and it have the same items for the initial list.

03:49.530 --> 03:56.850
We update the second item banana with the new item orange.

03:56.890 --> 04:01.010
Initial list is the same, only the copy list is changed.

04:02.730 --> 04:06.770
This is the reason why we need a copy list in Python.

04:07.450 --> 04:11.340
Second section, use the list method or the list constructor.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.260
Here we have our initial list.

04:15.780 --> 04:26.060
We pass our list as a parameter in the constructor list to create our copy of the list.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.980
Let's execute the code and see the result.

04:31.380 --> 04:36.740
We have a new list which contains the same items for the initial list.

04:38.540 --> 04:47.980
Let's try update the second item for the new list and see if the initial list will change it or not.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.700
Our initial list contains three items.

04:55.740 --> 04:56.100
Apple.

04:56.140 --> 04:56.620
Banana.

04:56.620 --> 04:57.660
Cherry.

04:57.700 --> 05:01.740
Here, when we create our copy list, it contains.

05:01.780 --> 05:02.060
Apple.

05:02.100 --> 05:02.540
Banana.

05:02.580 --> 05:03.060
Cherry.

05:03.820 --> 05:09.660
After a change, we update the second item by orange.

05:11.340 --> 05:19.060
After a change, we have apple, orange and cherry, but the initial list remained the same.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.740
The initial item is banana is not changed.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.700
Third, use the slice operator.

05:33.220 --> 05:37.980
When we don't specify start and end value, we will copy.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.220
All the items of the list.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.620
Let's execute only the three line of code.

05:52.340 --> 05:59.460
When we use the slice operator and we don't specify start and end value, we will copy all the items

05:59.620 --> 06:00.460
of the list.

06:00.700 --> 06:05.740
Let's do the same test like in the first and the second section.

06:05.740 --> 06:13.150
We try to update the second item for the new list, and we see if the initial list was changed or not.

06:13.550 --> 06:14.990
Let's execute the code.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.310
This is my copy list.

06:21.470 --> 06:24.990
Contain all the item like the initial list.

06:25.030 --> 06:25.430
Apple.

06:25.470 --> 06:25.910
Banana.

06:25.950 --> 06:26.430
Cherry.

06:27.310 --> 06:35.710
After the change of the second item, the new list contain apple, orange and cherry.

06:35.710 --> 06:40.070
But the initial list like we see here, it remained the same.

06:40.790 --> 06:44.750
The second item, always banana, is not changed.

06:49.710 --> 06:56.910
Just remember that we cannot copy a list only by assigning list one to list two.

06:56.950 --> 07:06.350
But we need to use one of three method to copy a list, the first using the method copy, the second

07:06.350 --> 07:12.430
using the constructor list and the third using the slice operator.

07:12.470 --> 07:13.910
That's it for this video.
