00:00.560 --> 00:01.600
Hi everyone!

00:01.920 --> 00:05.480
In this video we will learn together how to change list items.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.680
First, change item value.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.960
To change the value of a specific item, we refer to the index number.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.560
Here we have a list with three items.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.160
We change the second item banana.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.760
Refer to the index one.

00:20.240 --> 00:20.800
The new list.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.160
It will contain apple, blackcurrant and cherry.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.520
Second, change a range of item values to change the value of items within a specific range.

00:31.520 --> 00:39.000
We define a list with the new values, and we refer to the range of index number where you want to insert

00:39.000 --> 00:39.960
the new values.

00:40.360 --> 00:53.800
We define our new lists, and after that we refer the range one colon three where you want to insert

00:53.800 --> 00:54.840
the new values.

00:55.720 --> 01:01.640
The index one here is banana, the index two it will be cherry, the index three orange.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.640
But always the end value is not included.

01:05.280 --> 01:13.130
We will replace the second and the third item by new items blackcurrant and watermelon.

01:14.490 --> 01:21.250
The new list will contain apple, blackcurrant, watermelon, orange, kiwi and mango.

01:21.850 --> 01:27.970
If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified and the

01:27.970 --> 01:30.450
remaining items will move accordingly.

01:31.410 --> 01:39.050
Here we change the second item banana, with two new items blackcurrant and Watermelon.

01:40.210 --> 01:40.810
One, two.

01:41.530 --> 01:45.530
This means the item banana two is not included.

01:46.210 --> 01:53.090
The new list will contain apple, blackcurrant, watermelon and cherry.

01:53.130 --> 01:58.770
If you insert less item than you replace, the new item will be inserted where you specified and the

01:58.770 --> 02:01.090
remaining item will move accordingly.

02:01.890 --> 02:11.380
Here we replace two items banana and cherry and exit by one colon three, which means banana.

02:11.780 --> 02:14.260
And the third item, cherry.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.460
We replace it by only one item.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.140
The new list will contain apple.

02:19.260 --> 02:20.380
Watermelon.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.900
The length move from 3 to 2.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.340
Third section.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.460
Insert items to insert a new list item without replacing any of the existing value.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
We can use the insert method.

02:35.140 --> 02:39.540
The insert method inserts an item at the specified index.

02:40.380 --> 02:46.260
Here we insert watermelon as the third item indexed by two.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.180
Apple has the index zero.

02:49.180 --> 02:50.940
Banana has the index one.

02:50.980 --> 02:52.500
Cherry has the index two.

02:53.500 --> 02:59.140
We insert a new item watermelon in the index two, and the cherry will take the index three.

02:59.980 --> 03:08.260
As a result of the example above, the list will now contain four items Apple, banana, watermelon,

03:08.860 --> 03:10.420
and cherry.

03:11.260 --> 03:18.070
Let's go to PyCharm and do some practice to understand more how to change list items.

03:22.230 --> 03:26.550
First, change item value referring to the index number.

03:27.550 --> 03:31.950
Here we replace the second item banana by a new item Blackcurrent.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.430
The new list.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.270
It will be apple, blackcurrant and cherry.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.630
Let's execute the code.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.990
This is the result.

03:43.990 --> 03:44.470
Apple.

03:44.630 --> 03:45.510
Blackcurrant.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.510
The new item and the cherry.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.350
Change a range of item values.

03:56.510 --> 04:04.710
To change a range of item value, we prepare a new list and we specify the range of index, the start

04:04.710 --> 04:06.470
and the end value.

04:07.590 --> 04:14.470
Here we will update the range of index one until three one.

04:14.470 --> 04:21.640
It will be banana, two it will be cherry three, which is orange is not included here.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.960
We will replace the second and the third item by new.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Two items blackcurrant and watermelon.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.560
The length of the list.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.960
It will remain the same.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.400
Why?

04:32.440 --> 04:37.320
Because we are replacing two items by two new items.

04:37.320 --> 04:37.920
The result?

04:37.920 --> 04:39.040
It will be Apple.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.480
Blackcurrant.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.320
Watermelon.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.880
And after that orange and kiwi.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.920
Let's execute the code and see the result.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.880
What will be the result?

04:53.680 --> 05:01.400
The length of items before change and after the change is the same because we change it to items by

05:01.440 --> 05:02.560
new to items.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.040
Apple.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.080
Blackcurrant.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.040
Watermelon.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.120
The new items and the old items.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.600
Orange and kiwi.

05:15.160 --> 05:20.840
The length of the list will change when the number of items insert does not match the number of items

05:20.840 --> 05:21.600
replaced.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.610
In our first example, We changed two items.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.250
Buy two new items.

05:28.730 --> 05:34.370
The length remained the same, but there are two cases when the length changed.

05:34.930 --> 05:35.730
First case.

05:35.890 --> 05:40.170
Insert more items than you replace in the second case.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.810
Insert less items than you replace.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.010
Let's start by the first case.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.090
Insert more items than you replace.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.490
Here we will replace the second item.

05:51.690 --> 05:52.330
Banana.

05:52.490 --> 05:53.890
Buy two new items.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.010
The length of the list is three.

05:56.730 --> 06:00.330
After the change the length of the list it will be four.

06:01.410 --> 06:02.930
Let's execute the code.

06:06.890 --> 06:08.090
And see the result.

06:11.210 --> 06:12.730
The length of the list is three.

06:13.930 --> 06:16.490
We changed the item banana.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.010
Buy two new items.

06:18.050 --> 06:20.650
Blackcurrant and watermelon.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.490
Blackcurrant and watermelon.

06:24.730 --> 06:26.010
Cherry.

06:26.050 --> 06:35.300
Take the third index From 2 to 3, and the length of the list is four.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.060
Let's go to the second case.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.780
Case two insert less items than you replace.

06:44.700 --> 06:49.820
Here we will replace the second and the third item by only one item.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.540
Watermelon one.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.100
It will be banana.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.860
Two it will be cherry.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.260
We will replace it by only one item.

06:57.420 --> 06:58.580
Watermelon.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.860
The new list will contain apple and watermelon.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.940
The length move from 3 to 2.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.500
Let's execute the code and see the result.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.820
Number of items before change is three.

07:20.300 --> 07:20.660
Apple.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.220
Banana.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.740
Cherry.

07:22.780 --> 07:28.820
After we do the change, the new list contain apple and watermelon.

07:28.860 --> 07:31.620
The number of items after change is two.

07:35.590 --> 07:40.110
In the third section, insert items to insert new items.

07:40.550 --> 07:45.270
We use the method insert referring to the index number.

07:45.790 --> 07:50.270
Here we will insert a new item in the index two.

07:52.710 --> 07:53.470
The result.

07:53.470 --> 07:57.030
It will be a new list which contain Apple, banana.

07:57.430 --> 08:04.110
Watermelon which take the place of cherry and cherry will take the index three.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.750
Let's execute the code.

08:08.790 --> 08:13.110
The result is apple, banana, watermelon and cherry.

08:15.710 --> 08:17.790
In the first and the second section.

08:17.950 --> 08:29.430
We do the replacing of existing item, the first by value, the second by range of index, and in the

08:29.430 --> 08:35.390
third section we insert the new item without replacing any existing item.

08:38.870 --> 08:40.270
That's it for this video.
